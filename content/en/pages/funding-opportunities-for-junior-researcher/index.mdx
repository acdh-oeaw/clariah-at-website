  CLARIAH-AT supports early career researchers in Digital Humanities & Cultural
  Heritage at MA and PhD level with various bursaries.

CLARIAH-AT aims to support early career researchers at MA and PhD level, who have little or no other funding opportunity, in carrying out research in the fields of Digital Humanities. The consortium regards the funding as an investment in the future of Digital Humanities in Austria. Currently, early career researchers can apply for software licenses or Transkribus credits required for their current papers and projects as well as for travel grants to actively participate in conferences or networking opportunities.

## Transkribus Scholarships

With a CLARIAH-AT **Transkribus scholarship**, early career researchers in the field of Digital Humanities (DH) & Cultural Heritage based in Austria can claim free Transkribus credit packages for the (handwritten) text recognition of their research material within the framework of their thesis, dissertation, paper or individual project (without 3rd party funding).

Please send us a short description of the project or paper you are working on as well as some background information about yourself using the [application form on the Transkribus Website](https://readcoop.eu/transkribus/scholarship/clariah/). The data as well as the research results of the project or the respective work should be made available and re-usable by the Digital Humanities & Cultural Heritage research community in the context of the FAIR data principles.

## License Pool for Software

Software licenses for programmes used for research in the field of Digital Humanities & Cultural Heritage are often expensive. With this bursary, the consortium aims to support young scholars who need specific **software for the implementation of their research work**, but do not receive funding for it via their university or place of work.

In principle, up to €500 may be requested per application (higher amounts are possible in well-justified exceptional cases). Per person and year, a maximum of €1,000 in scholarships may be awarded through the submission of multiple applications; however, double funding of the same software product is not permitted.

If you are working on such a project, please fill out the following form to give us a brief overview of your project and yourself and send it to: [early-career@clariah.at](mailto:early-career@clariah.at).

## Travel Grants

CLARIAH-AT has reserved funds to **support travel and networking activities** of early career researchers at Austrian institutions with only limited or no other sources of funding: The grants are aimed at students and young scholars based at an Austrian institution who wish to present a part of their current research in the fields of Digital Humanities & Cultural Heritage in the form of a paper or poster at a conference, or want to acquire skills needed for their research through participation in a workshop.

In principle, up to €500 per application can be granted (higher amounts are possible in well-argued exceptional cases). Per person and year, a maximum of €1,000 in scholarship funding may be awarded through the submission of multiple applications; however, double funding of the same trip is not permitted.

To apply for a travel grant, please fill in the application form (see word file below). We ask you to provide us with information about yourself, your project and the planned trip, including a cost calculation for traveling, accommodation and participation in the conference. (Costs for meals are not covered!)

Please send your application, including the completed form and the cost calculation to: [early-career@clariah.at](mailto:early-career@clariah.at).
