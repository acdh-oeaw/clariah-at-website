> The loss is a severe and painful one! Thierry was a wonderful person, a wise and persistent

> In heartfelt memory!

> The passing of our dear colleague and friend has truly hit us unexpectedly. Deeply saddened we
> think of the many endeavours we worked on together, the many hours we spent on compiling papers,
> on writing code, on standards, on ontologies and dictionaries. We remember the excellent
> researcher, the universally interested scientist, the committed and open-minded scholar, the
> great traveller, ever-patient teacher, ever-collegial co-worker who never ceased to be cheerful
> even in discussion and debate. He leaves a hurtful gap and will be missed greatly.

> When I started working at ACDH(-CH) in 2015, together with a colourful bunch of young people,
> Thierry was one of the first "seniors" who just showed up in my office to ask me who I was, what
> I liked to do and how I was doing at the newly founded institute. I had the pleasure of meeting
> this Thierry again and again in the years that followed: A well-known luminary in his field, with
> a genuine interest in the people he works with. I will miss his spontaneous visits to my office
> as well as the numerous evenings in Viennese taverns.

> Farewell, my friend

> With these words, our colleague Thierry Declerck had commented on his tightly scheduled
> conference day in a hurried message. Back then, in 2012, "everything was so far in the green
> range" and our collaboration had just begun – numerous other projects at ACDH-CH with
> conferences all over the world were soon to follow.
>
> Looking back today, this short quote is a testimony of Thierry's tireless commitment to the
> international research community and to our institute in particular: His extraordinary
> commitment, scientific expertise and experience, as well as his open-mindedness towards new
> collaborations and research projects will remain unforgotten at ACDH-CH.

> Thierry Declerck was one of the first colleagues I met when I started working at the ACDH-CH
> several years ago. He immediately took me by the hand and shared his passion about lexicography,
> lexicographic resources, ontologies and standard with me. Being fluent in various languages, he
> has been a great language expert who also had a great interest in the theoretical, thus rather
> technical aspects of language and its concepts. This might feed into the several reasons why he
> loved teaching: As far as I can remember he participated each year in various Summer and Winter
> schools, workshops and conferences to teach the world about *Ontolex-Lemon, Wordnets, Sense
> Linking* and Semantic Web Technologies.
>
> He had a sixth sense in detecting and finding suitable candidates to mentor and take under his
> wings in order to push them further into defining their research interests, and delivering
> suggestions to publish papers and hold presentations together, thus introducing and establishing
> these candidates in the academic research society.
>
> Thierry has been a person who left no stone unturned: after the project is before the next
> project (proposal), with the next trip just around the corner, off to some sophisticated city to
> bring people together to sit on a table and discuss smart ideas.
>
> He always wore a smile on his face and did not hesitate to make a joke or two.
>
> Thierry, you will be dearly missed!
