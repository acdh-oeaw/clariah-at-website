The DARIAH Annual Event 2026 will take place on **May 26th to May 29th** in Rome, Italy. Our host for this year’s event is [CNR: Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche](https://www.cnr.it/en). May 26th will be a day for DARIAH internal meetings, followed by the main conference on May 27th to May 29th.

This year’s event will explore the topic of **Digital Arts and Humanities With and For Society: Building Infrastructures of Engagement**.

#### **Call for Papers**

The theme of DARIAH’s 2026 Annual Event is to explore digitally-enabled research through a public and participatory lens, focusing on who our research is for, what are its social and public benefits, and how research can serve to create new dialogues within the public sphere. We seek to foster exchanges on how digital infrastructures, networks and collaborative methods can enable and sustain forms of scholarship that are open, flexible and socially responsive. A way to frame this is through the concept of hybridity: an intermingling of ‘disciplines, technological and cultural practices’ which embed within them the goal of connectivity. This may be connectivity of the university or memory institutions with society through collaborative and joint engagements, or it might be providing alternative spaces for/where people can connect and interact through a hybrid network of physical and technology-mediated encounters to co-construct knowledge.’

Whether through scholarly reflections, concrete case studies, theoretical contributions, or policy considerations, this year we seek to explore how digital, social and institutional infrastructures can support engaged research, and nurture generosity, participation and shared creativity in the digital arts and humanities.

We welcome contributions on a variety of topics, including but not limited to:

* Infrastructures of engagement: designing open, inclusive, collaborative, and sustainable platforms
* New models of collaboration across academia, memory institutions, and society
* Pedagogies of engagement and public-facing (digital) humanities education
* Mapping engagement: Evaluating and evidencing public value and impact in digital research
* Preservation, stewardship, and resilience in digital knowledge infrastructures
* Co-creation, citizen science, public and participatory humanities, and community-driven, engaged scholarship
* Policy and governance frameworks for sustaining participatory infrastructures
* Creative and artistic practices as forms of public engagement and dialogue
* The role of digital archives and participatory practices in shaping collective memory and identity
* Ethical and sustainable approaches to participatory digital-enabled  research
* Implementing CARE: Designing digital infrastructures that foster trust, diversity, inclusion, and accessibility
* Intercultural and transnational perspectives on public digital humanities
* Research infrastructure as critical Infrastructure – strategies to build resilient infrastructure for engagement and public good
* Policy and governance frameworks for sustaining participatory infrastructures
