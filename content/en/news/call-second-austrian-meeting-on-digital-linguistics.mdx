  This year's workshop "Second Austrian Meeting on Digital Linguistics" aims to
  highlight recent developments in the Austrian research landscape and to
  connect different projects working with or on methods in digital linguistics,
  as well as the researchers involved.

Digital linguistics is a growing interdisciplinary field at the intersection of linguistics, information technology, and the social sciences. This is reflected by the growing number of new projects, publication series, and university courses. A central focus of digital linguistics is language data, i.e., digital artifacts that use human language as a form of expression. The range of this language data includes social media content, parliamentary transcripts, newspapers and medieval manuscripts, among others. Such data is processed, annotated, analyzed, curated, shared, archived, and reused, among other activities. Therefore, the topics covered in this workshop span from the creation of digital language resources (corpora, dictionaries, etc.) and their analysis (e.g., semantic change detection, emotion and sentiment analysis), to the use of standards and research infrastructures, as well as methods for long-term archiving or reuse of language data.

The variety of research in this field in Austria was shown during the first [**Austrian Meeting on Digital Linguistics**](https://clariah.at/en/events/digital-linguistics-recent-developments-in-austria-olt-2023/) and the previous [Austrian Meetings on Sentiment Inferenz (ÖTSI 2021, 2023)](https://evsl.univie.ac.at/digital-philology/oesterreichisches-treffen-zu-sentimentinferenz-oetsi/), where 37 researchers from different Austrian and international research institutions presented their projects.

This year's workshop "Second Austrian Meeting on Digital Linguistics" is a follow-up of these workshops. Again, the aim of the workshop is to highlight recent developments in the Austrian research landscape and to connect different projects working with or on methods in digital linguistics, as well as the researchers involved. The workshop aims to facilitate the exchange of methodological insights and the creation of synergies through the mutual sharing of digital language resources, also within the framework of the research infrastructure CLARIAH-AT. Furthermore, the workshop also addresses international researchers, who are working in the field of digital linguistics and who want to present their research and exchange and connect with the Austrian research community.

## Submissions

Abstracts (approx. 400 words, in PDF format) for presentations (20 minutes) on topics related to digital linguistics can be submitted until **September 15, 2024**, to the following email address [digital-linguistics@uibk.ac.at](mailto:digital-linguistics@uibk.ac.at). All submissions will be reviewed by at least 2 workshop organizers.
