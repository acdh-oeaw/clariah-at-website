The [White Paper (Weißbuch) Digital Edition](https://www.digitale-edition.at/) was created as part
of the federally funded Austrian project _Kompetenznetzwerk Digitale Edition_ and was published in
early 2021. It contains more than 200 contributions written by authors from 10 Austrian universities
and other institutions. The contributions are assigned to different subject areas, and are
represented in an index and a network diagram to locate content:

- Edition studies in general: types of editions, general editorial topics such as interpretation,
  collation, normalisation, palaeography, etc.
- Digitisation: digitisation services, tools, costs, and standards
- Annotation and modelling: articles on data modelling and models, modelling standards, schemas and
  the semantic web
- Metadata and metadata formats
- NLP: articles on computer-assisted language processing Interfaces: design and components
- Interfaces: design and components
- Data analysis: e.g. articles on networks, visualisation tools
- Archiving: archiving strategies and digital sustainability
- Software and software development: software for creating digital editions and theoretical aspects
- Legal aspects: deployment of Digital Editions, copyright, licensing.

The aim of the _White Paper_ (Weißbuch) was (and is) to provide a low-threshold introduction to the
extensive subject of Digital Editions. The _White Paper_ is intended to help users help themselves
(basic explanations, further articles and literature). The individual articles, which are very open
in terms of content, are divided into the actual article, the bibliography (referenced works as well
as introductory or further literature
[in a thematic Zotero library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/1332658/konde)) and a link list with
internal hyperlinks as well as links to other encyclopedias, thematically appropriate software, and
relevant projects.

Despite the large number of contributions, the _White Paper_ does not fully cover the complex
subject of digital editions. Moreover, since its publication, new research questions and topics have
emerged and new keywords (e.g. minimal editing, data management plan) keep appearing for which
further explanation and inclusion in the _White Paper on Digital Edition_ would be quite useful. It
is also necessary to revise some already published articles in the light of new developments and to
introduce new perspectives. New project descriptions are intended as practical examples from the
editors' point of view that complement new and existing articles: links between articles and project
content descriptions.
