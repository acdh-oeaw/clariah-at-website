We are pleased to present to you the [2023 Annual Report](https://www.dariah.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/TCD-DARIAH-Annual-Report-2023.pdf).

In a year marked by growth and significant new achievements, DARIAH steadfastly continued to pursue its mission of empowering research communities with digital methods to create, connect and share knowledge about culture and society.

2023 was by far the most successful year in DARIAH’s history when it comes to securing external funding. The five new Horizon Europe projects including [ATRIUM](https://atrium-research.eu/) (Advancing Frontier Research in Arts and Humanities), a 10-million€ project which DARIAH coordinates, are bound to substantially improve our operational capabilities and facilitate access to infrastructural offerings throughout Europe.

DARIAH also welcomed two new countries: Switzerland and Spain. Both joined DARIAH with strong national consortia which enhanced our cultural and linguistic diversity while reinforcing our European infrastructure with new expertise and resources.

These are only few of the 2023 highlights presented in this report. We invite you to explore it, not just as an account of our past year’s work but as an invitation to engage with us in shaping the future of DARIAH, as we are currently celebrating DARIAH’s first decade.
