### Format of the Programme Sessions

The programme of the conference will include oral presentations and posters, and may also include demos. Due to limits in the time schedule, the number of oral presentations is limited. Authors can select if they prefer a poster presentation. If not, papers are allocated a presentation format based on the suitability of the paper for a session as decided by the programme committee. Authors of accepted submissions will be offered the opportunity to demo their work in addition to their presentation. 

---

## Submissions

The language of the conference is English and presentations will be made in English. Proposals for oral, poster or demo presentations must be submitted as ***extended abstracts*** (length: 3 to 4 pages A4, including references) in PDF format, in accordance with the template ([ZIP-archive](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/t0y7zfm7fc2ubo01gawo4/ABS07ggkXbYm9yAZPfHAfpk?rlkey=fm7di983ihtivq02fbssfwrav\&st=mmwwallp\&dl=0), [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/xsvjrhvjyfmj#f3362f) template). Authors can choose whether to submit on an anonymous or non-anonymous basis.  

Extended abstracts should address one or more topics that are **relevant to CLARIN’s activities, resources, tools or services.** This relevance should be **explicitly articulated** in the submission, as well as in the presentation at the conference. Contributions addressing desiderata for the CLARIN infrastructure that are currently not in place are also eligible. Authors are not required to be or have been directly involved in national or cross-national CLARIN projects.

Extended abstracts must be submitted through the [EasyChair submission system](https://easychair.org/conferences/submission_new?a=33846748) and will be reviewed by the Programme Committee. All proposals will be reviewed on the basis of the following criteria:

* Appropriateness: The contribution must pertain to the CLARIN infrastructure or be relevant for it (e.g. its use, design, construction, operation, exploitation, illustration of possible applications, etc.), and this relevance should be explicitly articulated in the submission.
* Soundness and correctness: The content must be technically and factually correct and methods must be scientifically sound, according to best practice, and preferably evaluated.
* Meaningful comparison: The abstract must indicate that the author is aware of alternative approaches, if any, and highlight relevant differences.
* Substance: Concrete work and experiences will be given preference over ideas and plans.
* Impact: Contributions with a higher impact on the research community and society more broadly will be given preference over papers with lower impact.
* Clarity: The abstract should be clearly written and well structured.
* Timeliness and novelty: The work must convey relevant new knowledge to the audience at this event.

## Attendance

For each accepted abstract, CLARIN ERIC offers one author free access, free accommodation and meals . Travelling costs are not covered by CLARIN ERIC. Authors are encouraged to reach out to their national consortium, to their home institution or to third party funds to cover travel costs.
