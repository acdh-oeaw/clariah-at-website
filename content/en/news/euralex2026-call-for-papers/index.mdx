summary: >-
  The EURALEX-Board invites contributions on the theme "Lexicography in the age
  of AI".

  Submission deadline: 1. February 2026
---
The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) has begun to transform the ways in which lexicographic data are compiled, analysed, and presented. Large language models, advanced corpus tools, and other machine learning methods offer unprecedented opportunities to accelerate tasks such as the extraction of lexical information, the induction of word senses, or the drafting of definitions. They also make possible new forms of user interaction, including conversational and personalized dictionaries that can adapt to different audiences or integrate multimodal content such as text, sound, and images. 

At the same time, these technologies pose serious challenges that go beyond purely technical concerns. Automatically generated content raises questions of reliability, bias, and transparency, while the integration of opaque systems into lexicographic workflows risks undermining scholarly standards of quality and accountability. The ecological impact of large-scale AI models must also be taken into consideration, raising doubts about their long-term sustainability in resource-intensive projects such as lexicography. Finally, the introduction of AI into the field invites reflection on the role of the lexicographer: how can human expertise remain central when automation is increasingly pervasive, and what kinds of collaborations between humans and machines are both effective and responsible? 

The conference **Lexicography in the Age of AI** will provide a forum for discussing these promises and risks. We will bring together professional lexicographers, publishers, researchers, software developers, and anyone interested in dictionaries to consider both the potential of AI for creating more dynamic, interactive dictionaries, and the ethical and ecological responsibilities that come with it. 

## **WHERE**

The conference takes place from Tuesday, 29. September - Saturday, 3. October 2026 in the Main Building of the [**Austrian Academy of Sciences**](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/) , located in the heart of Vienna, Austria: Dr. Ignaz Seipel-Platz 2 , 1010 Vienna

With its theme **Lexicography in the Age of AI,** the conference aims to bring together professional lexicographers, linguists, publishers, researchers, software developers and anyone interested in dictionaries and their educational, cultural, political and social impact on everyday life. 

The conference will be organized as a hybrid event and while we encourage everyone to participate on-site, we plan to provide live streaming and recording of the event for registered participants. Please note that the authors are expected to present on-site though. 

The programme will include plenary lectures, parallel topic-related sessions, software demonstrations, presentations of new projects and young lexicographic professionals, pre-conference workshops, a book exhibition as well as social events. 

## **Call for papers**

Papers, posters, presentations of new projects and software demonstrations are invited on the topic “Lexicography in the Age of AI” as well as all lexicographically relevant topics including, but not limited to, the following fields: 

* Dictionary types and formats 

- Dictionary-making processes and methodology 

* Dictionary use and user needs  

- Corpora in lexicography  

* Phraseology and collocations  

- Lexicography and language technologies  

* Data infrastructure and lexicographic tools  

- Quality, ethics, and sustainability  

* Lexicology and linguistic foundations  

- Etymology and historical lexicography  

* Dictionary design and publication  

- Lexicography of lesser-used and under-researched languages  

* Collaborative and community lexicography 

The main topics are not meant to exclude any other lexicographic topic. Papers, posters, and demonstrations that are relevant to the congress, but do not fit into any of the above-mentioned categories, will be reviewed nonetheless and considered for presentation.  

### **Types of contributions**

When submitting your proposal, you can choose between the following types of contributions: 

* **Papers** (regular 20 min presentations plus 10 min discussion) 

- **Software demonstrations** (10 min. video demonstrations in a specific time slot) 

* **Posters** (to be presented in a dedicated poster session) 

Each proposal will be reviewed anonymously by a minimum of two members of the Scientific Committee. The Conference Proceedings will be published online and freely accessible ahead of the conference. It will also be submitted for indexing in Scopus. 

**The deadline for the submission** of abstracts with a **maximum of 800 words**, excluding references, tables, and figures, is **1 February 2026**.

Papers, software demonstrations and posters have to be submitted via the submission website on Easychair:
