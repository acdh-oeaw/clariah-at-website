## Computational and Historical Perspectives on Labour Market Evolution

### 24./25.4.2026 - University of Graz, Austria

**Workshop Topic**

This workshop brings together social and economic historians, labor economists, and digital humanities scholars who use textual sources (for instance job advertisements, ego-documents, legal documentation) to study historical economies of the labor markets.

In the context of the [Job Ads project](https://historical-job-ads.uni-graz.at/de/) at the University of Graz — whether in newspapers, trade journals, or early employment agencies — this unique window was used to glimpse into employer demand and labor supply: occupations, skills, gender expectations, and social norms. With digitization and advances in natural language processing (NLP), new possibilities emerge for systematic, large-scale analyses across time and place.

**The goal of the workshop** is to exchange experiences on how to prepare, model, and interpret textual sources like job ads data for economic, historical and digital research. We will discuss social and economic history of labor, methodological challenges (OCR, classification, text annotation, compa- rability across periods), share ongoing projects, and explore how computational tools can support broader historical questions about skill demand, gender segmentation, and structural change.

**Topics for Discussion**

* Historical sources that reveal changing skill requirements, technological shifts, and gendered labor markets.
* Insights from historical job advertisements for understanding labor market evolution.
* Methods for extracting structured social and economic information from historical textual data.
* Designing comparative and longitudinal studies of labor markets across countries and centuries drawing on data beyond already historically aggregations.
* How to link textual sources to economic taxonomies such as HISCO, ISCO, or occupational prestige scales.
* Approaches to aggregating and integrating newly created historical labor market data.

## **Call for Contributions**
