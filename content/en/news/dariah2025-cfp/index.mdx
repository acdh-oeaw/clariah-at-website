## **The Past**

### **About the Theme**

The Past encompasses a wide range of topics in the Digital Humanities, ranging from the study of ancient cultures to contemporary history. Indeed, the study of the past is greatly enriched by new technologies and methods, which have profoundly changed the ways that we do research today, from primary research (digitized collections), analysis (OCR, HTR, etc), transmission and communication (blogs, online meetings, conferences & classes), and beyond.\
DARIAH encourages submissions that leverage Digital Humanities approaches to analyze, interpret, and present historical and archaeological data. Whether through digital methods, workflows, archives, computational analysis, interactive media, or other digital means, DARIAH seeks to highlight innovative approaches to studying the past.

### **Topics of Interest**

DARIAH welcomes contributions on a variety of topics, including but not limited to:

* *Digital Archiving and Preservation*: Methods and challenges in digitizing and preserving historical documents, artifacts, and multimedia.
* *Historical Data Analysis*: Using big data, AI, and machine learning to uncover new insights into historical events and trends.
* *Virtual and Augmented Reality*: Applications of VR and AR in recreating historical environments and experiences.
* *Digital Storytelling*: Narratives of the past through digital media, including podcasts, interactive websites, and digital exhibitions.
* *Spatial explorations of the past*: Geo-referencing of historical maps and gazetteers, mapping mobility and spatial connections in historical networks.
* *Textual Analysis*: Digital methods for analyzing and interpreting historical texts, manuscripts, and inscriptions.
* *Crowdsourcing History*: Engaging the public in the collection and interpretation of historical data.
* *Historiography and Methodology*: The impact of digital tools on historical research methodologies and historiographical debates.
* *Interdisciplinary Approaches*: Collaborations between digital humanities and other fields such as archaeology, anthropology, and sociology.
* *Critical Perspectives*: Challenges and ethical considerations in the digital representation of historical data.
* *Pedagogical Practices*: The impact of digital humanities on teaching and learning about the past.
* *Contested Histories*: Discussions on the debates, controversies, and challenges that have marked the development of the digital humanities.
* *Reconstructed Histories*: How digital technologies have allowed us to reconstruct the past, in ways that would not have been possible before.
