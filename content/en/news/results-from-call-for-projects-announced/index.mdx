The response rate for the CLARIAH-AT funding call 2022 "Interoperability and re-usability of DH data
and tools" was very high, as was the quality of the applications received. Every project was
reviewed in detail by four members of the CLARIAH-AT consortium as well as by representatives of the
European infrastructures CLARIN and DARIAH.

Due to the quality of the applications, the decision was not easy, but finally, the consortium
selected the eight highest-rated projects to be funded by CLARIAH-AT. Projects will start in autumn
2022 and run until the end of 2023.
