On November 25th and 26th, 2024, a new edition of the [ONB Labs](https://labs.onb.ac.at/en/) Symposium will take place in the Oratorium of the Austrian National Library!

The event will be held in english and is dedicated to the exciting topic of research on historical newspapers within the field of Digital Humanities. As a medium, historical newspapers offer a plethora of challenges and potentials for institutions and researchers alike due to their sheer mass and heterogeneity. As distinct collections, they also closely relate to the concept of collections as data, which has been of very high importance for GLAM institutions and Labs in particular. This concept channels the many reactions and reflections that institutions are having regarding the question of how they can share their collections not just as physical objects, but also as data.

The ONB Labs are pleased to have attracted a large group of international experts as speakers to offer a wide-ranging program which will also include research reports and project presentations!&#x20;

Some of the questions addressed include:

* How can generative AI be used to advance research on historical newspapers?

- How can deep learning be used to automatically recognize certain elements of historical newspapers – and how can this process be explained?

* What role can “newspapers as datasets” play in the joint European Dataspace and in the European Collaborative Cloud for Cultural Heritage?

- What challenges are library labs and national libraries currently facing regarding historical newspapers?

A detailed program and the possibility to register for the event will follow shortly via the [ÖNB Labs Webseite](https://labs.onb.ac.at/de/topic/symposium-2024/). Please make a note of November 25th and 26th, 2024 (Nov. 25th: 1:45–8:30 p.m., Nov. 26th: 9:00 a.m. – 12:30 p.m.). As the symposium will be a physical event, the number of participants is limited.
