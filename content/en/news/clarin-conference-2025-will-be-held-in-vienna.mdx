We are pleased and excited to announce that the upcoming edition of the CLARIN Annual Conference 2025 will be held in Vienna, Austria!

The CLARIN Annual Conference is the annual event for those working on the construction and operation of CLARIN across Europe. It is organised for the wider humanities and social sciences communities in order to exchange ideas and experiences within the CLARIN infrastructure. This includes the design, construction and operation of the CLARIN infrastructure, the data, tools and services that it contains or for which there is a need, its actual use by researchers and teachers, its relation to other infrastructures and projects, and the CLARIN Knowledge Infrastructure.

The conference brings together of accepted papers, members of national consortia and representatives of CLARIN centres, representatives from partner organisations, and many others who are interested in becoming part of the CLARIN community.
