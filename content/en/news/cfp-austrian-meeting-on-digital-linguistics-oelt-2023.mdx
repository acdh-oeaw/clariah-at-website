Digital linguistics is a growing interdisciplinary field at the intersection of traditional linguistics, information technology, and social sciences. This can be seen by the growing number of new projects, publication series, and university courses. A central focus of digital linguistics is language data, i.e., digital artifacts that use human language as a form of expression. The range of this language data includes social media content, parliamentary transcripts, newspapers and medieval manuscripts, among others. Such data is processed, annotated, analyzed, curated, shared, archived, and reused, among other activities. Therefore, the topics covered in this field span from the creation of digital language resources (corpora, dictionaries, etc.) and their analysis, to the use of standards and research infrastructures, as well as methods for long-term archiving or reuse of language data.

Mörth and Wissik (2018) have already shown that Austria has a very active research landscape that engages with digital language resources in various ways and is embedded in the context of the European research infrastructure for digital language resources CLARIN (Fišer & Witt, 2022) and its Austrian counterpart CLARIAH-AT. Recent developments, such as new projects, university courses on digital linguistics, confirm that it is also a rapidly growing field in Austria.

**The aim of this workshop** is to highlight recent developments in the research landscape in Austria and to connect different projects from the Austrian research community that work with or on methods in digital linguistics, as well as the researchers involved. The workshop aims to facilitate the exchange of methodological insights and the creation of synergies through the mutual sharing of digital language resources, also within the framework of CLARIAH-AT.
