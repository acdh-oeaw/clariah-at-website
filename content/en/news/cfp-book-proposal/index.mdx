to be published at a top-ranked international publisher

Coordinated/edited by Diana Roig-Sanz and Philipp Hofeneder

## Description

In the last twenty years, digital humanities made a splash in the literary field, but digital methods have slowly seeped into translation studies and, particularly, into translation history. Undoubtedly, there are multiple definitions of digital humanities, but there is still no consensus regarding how they can be applied to translation studies and to translation history, more specifically. As it's well-known, digital humanities methods have been mainly related to corpora studies, bibliometric and bibliographical research, translation technology, and the gathering and analysis of online available metadata. However, these research avenues do not always consider the whole range of methodological possibilities and practical applications on which the digital humanities are based on. Among them, we would like to highlight the general principles of long-term preservation, digital editions of (historical) translations, as well as the enrichment with further semantic data, especially in the case of historical translation databases, or the use of AI. As humanities researchers we still tend to think "small", but we have now the chance to think "big" and we urgently need some theoretical and methodological reflections, as well as empirical case studies that allow us to set the grounds of the discipline and offer general standards for our community.
