### A Book on LOD and other Data Networks in the Digital Humanities

The 30th issue of the OA special edition is dedicated to computational medieval research in its connective function. As an interface, it mediates between disciplines, the digital and the analogue, heterogeneous research subjects and diverse methods. In doing so, it not only integrates approaches and knowledge from other disciplines, but also contributes to gaining knowledge beyond its own discipline. The aim of this volume is to present collaborative methods of the *Digital Humanities* in a research-orientated and practical way and to evaluate and discuss the methods and practices used.

Members of the CLARIAH-AT consortium supported this initiative in the preparatory stages so that this book could be published.
