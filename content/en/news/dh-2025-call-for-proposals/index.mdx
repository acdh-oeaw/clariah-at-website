The Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations (ADHO) invites submission of proposals for its annual conference, at Universidade NOVA de Lisboa (NOVA FCSH), Lisbon, Portugal, July 14-18, 2025.

### **Building access and accessibility, open science to all citizens**

In 2002, the Budapest Open Access Declaration amplified the need to make research more widely available and free to anyone with internet access. Lately, Open Science or Open Scholarship have reframed concepts such as openness, access and accessibility from a technical and ethical perspective, taking into consideration data, infrastructure, and/or collaboration. National, international, or organizational manifestos, statements, declarations, principles, and policies related to scholarly objects, practices or methods are being formulated to improve and accelerate research through increased transparency, collaboration, and a more inclusive access to scientific knowledge of our societies.

By leveraging digital tools and methodologies, the digital humanities have been aiming at democratizing access to knowledge, fostering community engagement, and addressing contemporary societal needs and challenges in several meaningful ways.

We encourage submissions from all who work in all digital humanities disciplines, methodologies, and pedagogies, including students and early career scholars. We particularly invite proposals that relate to the theme, including but not limited to the following topics:

* Open, Public, Participatory Humanities
* Crowdsourcing Initiatives
* Citizen Science/Citizen Humanities
* Equity, Diversity and Inclusivity (EDI) Framework
* Digital Multilingual Practices
* Technology to Improve Accessibility
* Inclusive Platforms
* Digital Archives & Collections
* Cultural Preservation
* FAIR and CARE principles
* Ethics of AI in the Humanities
* Situated Approaches to Digital Humanities Teaching and Pedagogy
* Critical Digital Literacy
* Interface and Enunciation
* Innovations in Free/Libre and Open-Source Software or Hardware adapted to DH projects
* Environmental Sustainability in Digital Humanities
* Advocacy and Social Impact

Proposals must be submitted via[ https://www.conftool.pro/dh2025/](https://www.conftool.pro/dh2025/)

**Deadline for Submissions:** December 8th, 2024

**Notification of Acceptances:** **February 21st, 2025**

Participants who wish to present online will be able to do so, and may also ask questions in the sessions in which they present their work. The online public will only be able to watch the sessions, but not ask questions.
