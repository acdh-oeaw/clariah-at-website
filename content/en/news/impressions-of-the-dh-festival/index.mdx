On December 4th 2025, the [**Central European University**](/consortium/central-european-university/) (CEU) hosted the first [Digital Humanities Festival](/events/clariah-at-roadshow-at-CEU/), sponsored by the **CLARIAH-AT** consortium.

The event welcomed many digital humanities scholars, students, research software engineers, and GLAM professionals from all around Austria.

The festival first featured a **CLARIAH-AT Roadshow** component with a CEU medley session with presentations by **Mark Wittek** and **Alíz Horváth** (the two CEU recipients of this year’s [CLARIAH-AT call for small-scale funded projects](/project-funding/)), as well as **Csaba Szilagyi** (Chief Archivist at the [OSA Archivum](https://archivum.org/about-us/staff/csaba-szilagyi)), followed by two students from the Department of Historical Studies at the CEU, **Saranya Chandran** (PhD student in Comparative History) and **Eva Kiser** (MA student in Museum Studies).

The morning continued with the CLARIAH-AT partner institutions’ project showcase with ten presentations that provided a glimpse into the rich diversity of the Austrian DH scene.

After lunch, which also offered plenty of opportunities for networking and exchange, the afternoon then brought a special project incubation workshop (in the style of ”*bring your project ideas, match them with digital tools*”) for members of the [**Cluster of Excellence EurAsian Transformations**](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/eurasian-transformations/home). With the participation of four colleagues from the <Link link={{"discriminant":"consortium","value":"austrian-academy-of-sciences"}}>**Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities (ACDH)**</Link>, this workshop offered an interactive platform for project consultation and ideation while bringing the Cluster closer to the CLARIAH-AT community.

It was wonderful to celebrate the beauty and value of Digital Humanities with such a large (and growing) community, and we hope that this inaugural event will serve as a starting point for many similar programs in the future.
