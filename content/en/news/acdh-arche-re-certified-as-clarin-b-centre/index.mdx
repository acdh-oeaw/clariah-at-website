    #### **CLARIN K-Centres: Knowledge Centres**

    K-centres **share their knowledge and expertise** on one or more aspects of the domain covered by the CLARIN infrastructure.

    The focus of CLARIN is on language resources (in all modalities, from all regions and with any topical orientation) and K-centres serve researchers and educators from any discipline where language plays one of its many roles, ranging from object of study, a means of communication or expression, a means to store and extract information, object of learning or teaching activities, to training source for data-driven analytics, and many others.
