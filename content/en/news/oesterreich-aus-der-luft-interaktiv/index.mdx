We are pleased to present a new visualisation and repository from the [ÖNB Labs](https://labs.onb.ac.at/en/):

An [interactive map](https://labs.onb.ac.at/en/topic/austroflug/) for visualising the recently published dataset ‘[Austria In Aerial Views](https://labs.onb.ac.at/en/datasets/austroflug/)’ is now available on a separate page. The map uses different colours to display locations, some of which were identified as part of a crowdsourcing project and others of which were added through automated data enrichment.

The code for the underlying Jupyter Notebook is published in an [associated repository](https://labs.onb.ac.at/gitlab/labs-team/austroflug-notebook) (GitLab). The notebook was created as part of the CLARIAH-AT funded project 'Data Analysis in the ÖNB Labs'.

The [ÖNB Labs team](mailto:labs@onb.ac.at) welcomes feedback and invites active engagement with the data.
