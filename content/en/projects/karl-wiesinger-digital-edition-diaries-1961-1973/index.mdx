The digital edition of the diaries of the Linz writer Karl Wiesinger provides a unique testimony to its time, literature and local history. Wiesinger's hitherto unpublished records from 1961 to 1973 document his development as a literary and political outsider in Austrian culture and also provide information about daily life marked by the Cold War and the social atmosphere in post-war Linz. The diaries are encoded in the XML-TEI format. The digital edition includes comprehensive information on the author's life and work as well as commentaries on central aspects of the diaries. An index of persons, places, institutions and key words encoded in XML-TEI allows for focused research or transversal reading.
