The foundational skills at the intersection of digitization, bibliography, and the Digital Humanities are crucial for many scholars, yet instruction frequently only covers one maybe two of these intersecting aspects. For example, use of the Text Encoding Initiative XML standard is increasingly the norm in digital scholarly editing, but many individuals working with textual materials do not have access to relevant scholarly training in DH. Conversely, many DH departments, lack rare book specialists. The goal of this workshop is to create one succinct class where students will learn the necessary skills for understanding how the materiality of pre-modern books can be digitized and provide a foundation for putting those skills into practice. After attending this workshop, students will understand the fundamentals of digitization and how books and manuscripts are described in the TEI, including the msdescription and transcription modules. The workshop as an event is used to create materials which will be made into a video class for self-study.

## **Outcomes**

**Project Impact**

This project has filled a significant gap in the field of Digital Humanities, providing valuable resources for Digital Humanists who want to work with rare books and book historians interested in the Digital Humanities. Through the teaching materials and the winter school, the project has paved the way for scholars and students to understand how the materiality of pre-modern books can be digitized without having to go through inaccessibly expensive alternatives, such as the US-American Rare Book School where even online-only attendance is charged 1000$ for a one-week class.

We have managed to create a comprehensive resource that introduces students to the basics of digitizing the materiality of premodern books, orienting them towards where to find further information and encouraging their engagement with this significant aspect of DH and modern-day rare book librarianship. We believe that the success of this project marks a positive step in the field of Digital Humanities, particularly in relation to the study and digitization of rare books. It is our hope that the resources we have developed will serve as a cornerstone for further work in this exciting area at the intersection of rare books and Digital Humanities.
