The **Middle High German Conceptual Database ([MHDBDB](https://mhdbdb.sbg.ac.at/#/))** at the [**Paris Lodron University of Salzburg**](/consortium/university-of-salzburg/) is developing an innovative **Digital Humanities project** that applies artificial intelligence to historical language data.\
During the Heidelberg [Hackathon *“AI and the Middle Ages”*](https://hcdh.hypotheses.org/1915), the concept for **ParzivAI** emerged – a **Large Language Model (LLM)** capable of **automatically translating Middle High German texts into modern German**.\
This system will be released as an **Open Educational Resource (OER)** and follows the **FAIR principles** for open and sustainable research.\
**Objective:** to make medieval texts easily accessible for schools, universities, and the general public.

## About the Project

**ParzivAI** is designed for use in disciplines such as **German Studies**, **Linguistics**, **Digital Humanities**, **Computational Linguistics**, and **Medieval Studies**. The prototype was developed by Dr. Florian Nieser (Heidelberg Center for Digital Humanities, [HCDH](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/de/forschung/forschungsprofil/fields-of-focus/field-of-focus-iii/forschungsschwerpunkte/heidelberg-center-for-digital-humanities-hcdh)) and Thomas Renkert (Heidelberg School of Education). Initial tests with works such as *“Armer Heinrich”*, *“Erec”*, and *“Parzival”* have demonstrated the potential of **AI-based Middle High German translation** for research and education.

The **MHDBDB** contributed by providing selected historical text and metadata sets and by performing the **data preprocessing** in collaboration with Dr. Alan van Beek and Peter Färberböck.

To fully leverage the MHDBDB’s extensive data, further **data preparation** steps are required, including:

* Repairing faulty exports
* Converting data into open formats (JSON, XML)
* Providing TEI and RDF datasets
* Developing an **open API** for lemma queries – a prototype for *Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)*
* Creating a Zotero interface for secondary literature to generate additional synthetic training data

Continuing the cooperation with Heidelberg requires targeted investment in external IT development and project-related travel expenses.
