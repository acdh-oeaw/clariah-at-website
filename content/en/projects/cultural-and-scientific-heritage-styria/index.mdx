Project "Repository of Styrian Cultural Heritage"

The project is funded by the Federal Ministry of Science, Research and Economy and aims at the digital processing, protection, publication and accessibility of Styrian cultural and scientific heritage. The partner institutions hold a considerable number of manuscripts, photographs, constructional drawings, bequests and historical records of varying nature. The digital repository will make rare or unique cultural and scientific heritage of Styria available for teachers, researchers and students and for the scientific community. The hidden treasures of the area will be brought to light and used as the starting point for new scientific research and cultural activities.

Web portal "Cultural and Scientific Heritage of Styria"

Apart from the continuation of digitization and development of digital curation practices at the partner institutions the project "Repository of Styrian Cultural Heritage" aims at creating a common web portal. There, holdings of all partner institutions will be accessible and searchable. In addition to various search options descriptions of collections and objects, as well as virtual tours on specific topics offer further access. Thereby the portal also allows to playfully get to know parts of the Styrian cultural and scientific heritage. The result is the present web portal "Cultural and Scientific Heritage of Styria". The Centre for Information Modelling - Austrian Centre for Digital Humanitites is responsible for the realization of this web portal contributes its longstanding expertise in long-term archiving and administration of scientific and cultural heritage repositories.
