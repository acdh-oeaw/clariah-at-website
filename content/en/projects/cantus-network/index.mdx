**Liturgy and music in medieval Salzburg**

For many centuries, the metropolitan province of Salzburg with its episcopal and suffragan dioceses (Salzburg, Passau, Freising, Regensburg und Seckau) played a key role in the cultural history of Austria and Bavaria. It is thus all the more important that the many surviving liturgical musical sources which form an important part of this cultural heritage are made digitally accessible and subjected to scholarly analysis.
All this information needs in-depth examination of the _Libri Ordinarii_ to become scholarly exploitable. The project will thus create a scholarly edition including an in-depth analysis of the origins of the liturgy and the commentaries. The project will add the analysis of secondary sources (liturgical and musical liturgical manuscripts like graduals, missals, sequentiaries, antiphoners etc.) and edit them, spanning a network of information from the _Libri Ordinarii_. For this, a selection of these codices will be digitalised and completely inventoried.
The project thus creates a comprehensive and scholarly edited data pool available to re­searchers in various disciplines (liturgics and musicology, history, art history and palaeo­graphy). The project is interdisciplinary as it involves musicological, codicological, philological and digital humanities methods.
The _Liber Ordinarius_ as a textual genre need enriched editions which cannot be fully provided in printed forms. The project will provide the multi-layered texts digitally. It will create TEI/MEI docu­ments which will be semantically enriched through domain-specific controlled vocabularies.
The digitized and enriched objects will be managed, published and long-time archived in GAMS, the Fedora Commons based Humanities Asset Management System of the _Center for Information Modelling_, Graz (ZiM).
The five years research project is part of the digital humanities initiative _Long term projects of cultural heritage_ of the OeAW, funded by the _Austrian National Foundation for Research, Technology and Development_.
