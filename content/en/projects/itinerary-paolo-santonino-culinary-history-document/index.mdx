Paolo Santonino († 1507), the private secretary of the Patriarch of Aquileia, travels with a group of travellers led by the Bishop of Udine in three journeys through East Tyrol, Carinthia, Carniola and the former Mark an der Sann. In the course of these journeys, churches, chapels and cemeteries that had been desecrated during the Turkish invasions were to be rededicated. Santonino describes these journeys, which took place in the years 1485-87, the landscape and the people in great detail and lists, among other things, the names of the diners and the individual courses for each meal that was served.

The digital adaptation of the transmitted texts offers the following access to the material:

*   ### **Place index**


Lists the places visited in alphabetical order. It is possible to display the individual places on a modern map.

*   ### **Meals**


Lists the meals mentioned by Santonino in chronological order with the addition of the respective place. The tabular presentation lists the individual courses, if any are described. Within this list, the individual dishes are highlighted in italics.

*   ### **Interactive journey**


Here the route of the travel group is presented with the help of interactive presentation methods. In addition to a location of the individual stops on a modern map, excerpts from the German translation of the itinerary are provided, describing the travel conditions, places and, of course, the meals. This material is enriched with in-depth references and further explanations as well as modern visual material.
