The project DPP focuses on the depiction and analysis of space and place in medieval written sources, of the interaction between built and natural environment, of appropriation of space and of the emergence of new political, religious and economic structures of power. DPP compares three regions of the medieval world: the Eastern Alps (6th-12th cent.), the historical region of Macedonia (12th-14th cent.) and historical Southern Armenia (5th-11th cent.). With tools deriving from Digital Humanities, historical and archaeological data will be digitised, combined, geo-referenced and integrated into a data basis (using the OpenAtlas-system, which was enhanced by Stefan Eichert, Katharina Winckler and Alexander Watzinger for the projects “The Eastern Alps revisited” and “Mapping Medieval Conflict – MEDCON” and will be even more enriched for DPP with historical geographical features). To communicate the results of the spatial analyses as well as the historical and archaeological data and the spatial relations thereof, DPP (Team Department of Geography and Regional Research, University of Vienna) aims to create an interactive and dynamic map-based online application. It will be an integral part of the DPP project and provide a framework for various aspects of the project.
