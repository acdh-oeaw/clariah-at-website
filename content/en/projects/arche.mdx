ARCHE (A Resource Centre for the HumanitiEs) is a service that offers stable and persistent hosting as well as the dissemination of digital research data and resources for the Austrian humanities community. ARCHE welcomes data from all humanities fields.

ARCHE's primary mission is to provide easy and sustainable access to digital research data and resources for researchers in the humanities. To this end, it takes care of long term preservation of digital data, and promotes the use of open access and open data policies. Have a look at our [Collection Policy](https://arche.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/browser/collection-policy) to find out about the scope of ARCHE.

To support researchers in preparing their data for long term preservation, ARCHE offers a set of policies and standards as well as consulting.

As the successor of the Language Resources Portal (LRP), ARCHE is one of Austria's connection points to the European network of [CLARIN Centres](http://clarin.eu/centres).

ARCHE has embraced the [FAIR Data Principles](https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples) providing **F**indable, **A**ccessible, **I**nteroperable and **R**eusable data and metadata.

ARCHE is a service offered by the [ACDH-CH](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/acdh/), a national centre of expertise founded with the intention to promote the change towards the digital paradigms in the humanities.

ARCHE was awarded the [CoreTrustSeal](https://www.coretrustseal.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ARCHE.pdf) in 2017, a core level certification for trustworthy data repository systems.
