The digitization of collections held by Austrian museums, libraries, and other cultural institutions has opened new possibilities for accessing significant cultural heritage. The national portal [kulturpool.at](https://kulturpool.at) already provides a central research platform for holdings from various institutions, making it a valuable resource for research, teaching, and cultural mediation.\
The **Zukunft Kulturpool Visuell** project builds on this foundation by exploring and developing innovative visualization methods to improve the discoverability, visibility, and usability of these collections â€“ both for the academic community and for the interested public.

## Project Information

The project aims to develop several interactive collection visualizations that offer an intuitive overview of the entire dataset of kulturpool.at and enable exploratory browsing.\
Specifically, the project includes:

* **Visualization Design**: Analysis of the kulturpool database and design of suitable visualization approaches.
* **Visualization Development**: Implementation of at least three coordinated overview visualizations, e.g., showing temporal, geographical, and taxonomic aspects of the objects.
* **Case Study**: Testing advanced visualization methods using holdings from various CLARIAH partners (e.g., Austrian National Library, Austrian Academy of Sciences, University of Graz) and comparing them with existing interfaces.
* **Dissemination**: Publication of results, development of recommendations on metadata quality, provision of open interfaces, and release of open-source tools for reuse.

In the long term, the project seeks to improve data quality, foster synergies with European cultural data initiatives, and lay the groundwork for an implementation-oriented follow-up project.
