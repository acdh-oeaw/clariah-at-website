**CLARIAH-AT** coordinates Austria’s participation in the European research infrastructures [CLARIN](https://www.clarin.eu/) and [DARIAH](http://dariah.eu/), thereby enhancing the visibility, compatibility, and use of digital research resources in Austria. Against this backdrop, the current project carries additional strategic significance by developing a national platform that integrates seamlessly into the European landscape.

The digital research landscape in the humanities is evolving at a rapid pace. The **“CLARIAH-AT Platform”** project aims to establish a central digital infrastructure for Austria’s Digital Humanities (DH) community. Its primary goal is to improve the visibility and discoverability of research resources, projects, and services, while ensuring seamless integration with European initiatives such as **DARIAH-EU** and the [**European Open Science Cloud (EOSC)**](https://eosc.eu/eosc-about/). As a strategic contribution to the [**DHA Strategy 2021+**](https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:clariah.dha-strategie-2021), the project focuses in particular on strengthening repositories, enhancing metadata quality, and ensuring the sustainable provision of digital sources for research and teaching.

## Project Information

At the core of this initiative is the **redesign and expansion of the existing website clariah.at** into a comprehensive platform. This platform will serve as a central information and presentation hub for projects, datasets, tools, services, training materials, and publications within Austria’s Digital Humanities community. It is based on a modern technical setup that uses a git-based system with static HTML generation, combined with CMS support via the Keystatic Framework. This enables flexible, field-specific content structuring (e.g. for events or metadata) and long-term maintainability.

The technical development aligns with **DARIAH-EU’s “Pathways” strategies**, which promote structured, bidirectional integration of information flows between local systems and central European catalogues. Examples include tools from the [**SSH Open Marketplace**](https://marketplace.sshopencloud.eu/) or datasets from repositories such as [**ARCHE**](https://arche.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/browser/), [**GAMS**](https://gams.uni-graz.at/), and [**PHAIDRA**](https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/), made visible via [**OpenAIRE**](https://www.openaire.eu/).

A central aspect of the project is **manual curation** — reviewing and updating existing resources, as well as continuously expanding them. Controlled vocabularies such as [**TaDiRAH**](https://de.dariah.eu/tadirah) (Taxonomy of Digital Research Activities in the Humanities) are applied, and relevant materials from related initiatives like [**KONDE**](https://www.digitale-edition.at/) (Kompetenznetzwerk Digitale Edition) and [**DiTAH**](https://www.ditah.at/) (Digitale Transformation der österreichischen Geisteswissenschaften) are evaluated for potential integration. The development of a curated, searchable knowledge graph is planned, featuring both simple keyword search and faceted navigation by metadata (e.g. publication date, keywords, authors).

Possible extensions include:

* Blogs, podcasts, or video interviews with experts,
* Showcasing innovative projects and reflecting on methods and tools used,
* Providing contact overviews for experts in specific topics, methods, and tools.

The project is modular, encompassing technical development, design, and data integration.
