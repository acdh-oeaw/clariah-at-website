_Narrative Didactics_ is a project of the research group with the same name at the Center for Inter-American Studies at the University of Graz, founded in 2019, which studies and disseminates innovative approaches and methods that use stories and narrative practices to facilitate learning and teaching processes in education. The idea of Narrative Didactics is to expand the scope of didactics by providing alternative methods and tools to critically engage with the challenges of our times through narrative practices. Members of the research group study, work, and teach at Austrian schools, colleges and universities. The projects develops new teaching materials and approaches, which are dissemianted through active workshops in the educational sector. Starting at the beginning of June, the reserach group will work together with the University of Pésc and the University of Ca'Foscari on an Erasmus+ project to develop a digital toolkit for ESL/EFL teaching.
