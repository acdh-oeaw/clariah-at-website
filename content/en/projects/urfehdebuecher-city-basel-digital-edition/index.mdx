The digital edition of the Basler Urfehdebuch X from 1563 to 1569 represents a legal-historic source. In cooperation with the department of history of the University of Basel the source was encoded in TEI and further specific retrieval-functionalities based on a RDF data model, a categorization based on a controlled vocabulary and a "data-basket" for exporting selected entries, was implemented.
