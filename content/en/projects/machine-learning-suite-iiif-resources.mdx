Within the project, three use cases were developed to illustrate the application of machine learning to library datasets. Access to these datasets is facilitated using the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF), a widely adopted standard for delivering digital objects. This ensures that the developed applications can also be utilised for resources other than from the Austrian National Library. The following projects were developed:

*   colorisation of historic postcards incl. a tutorial to create a colorisation-model
*   extraction of images
*   classification of images using [Resnet18](https://huggingface.co/Axon/resnet18-v1)
