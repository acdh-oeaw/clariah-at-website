The project is developing the first *sentiment-annotated corpus* of **historical Austrian newspapers** spanning the years 1800 to 1938. The aim is to significantly advance **sentiment analysis** within **Digital Humanities** and **historical language processing**.\
Sentiment analysis – the automated detection and classification of emotions, attitudes, and opinions in texts – is a vital method in **text mining** and **computational linguistics**. Currently, there is no dedicated sentiment-annotated resource for Austrian German from the 19th and early 20th centuries. This project addresses this gap, enabling researchers to explore social narratives about **migration**, **minority groups**, and political discourse across different historical periods and ideological contexts.

## Project Information

Using curated collections from [**ANNO**](https://anno.onb.ac.at/) (Austrian National Library) and [**DIGITARIUM**](https://digitarium.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/digitarium) (Austrian Academy of Sciences), key newspapers such as *Wienerisches Diarium*, *Neue Freie Presse*, and *Arbeiter Zeitung* are being manually annotated for sentiment. The annotation process is conducted by trained annotators applying established **corpus annotation** methodologies with the [**Doccano**](https://github.com/doccano/doccano) tool. Quality control is ensured through inter-annotator agreement metrics.\
Completed work includes:

* Improving OCR accuracy to **86%** using **machine learning** techniques.
* Thematic structuring with **BERTopic** to focus on migration, minority groups, labor, education, and nationalism.
* Annotating over **700 instances** covering multiple timeframes and topics.

The project’s next steps involve expanding the sentiment annotation to additional periods (1800–1850, 1900–1938) and publishing the final dataset as an **open-access resource** on **Zenodo** in compliance with **FAIR data principles**. It will also be integrated into the [**GAMS repository**](https://gams.uni-graz.at/) and made discoverable through the **CLARIN Virtual Language Observatory ([VLO](https://vlo.clarin.eu/;jsessionid=7124EFA3F6601E3F2C43B30D78708A0D?0))**, strengthening global research infrastructure in Digital Humanities.
