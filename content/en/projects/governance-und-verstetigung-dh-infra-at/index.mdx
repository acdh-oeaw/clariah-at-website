**DH-Infra.at** – [*Digital Humanities Infrastructure Austria*](https://www.dhinfra.at/) – is a national initiative providing long-term access to advanced digital infrastructure for humanities and cultural heritage research in Austria. It connects the Digital Humanities community that has developed within the [**CLARIAH-AT consortium**](https://clariah.at/en/about-clariah-at/) and in earlier infrastructure projects. The aim is to support research processes that rely on the use of digitised sources, research software, and data science methods.\
The focus lies on four key infrastructure areas: **Machine Learning**, **Open-Source Software**, **Repositories**, and **Enhanced Sensing**. While these technologies are also available to other disciplines, they have often been planned without specific adaptation to the needs of the humanities. DH-Infra.at addresses this gap and ensures sustainable use.

## About the Project

The project aims to establish a basic infrastructure that will be fully operational by 30 June 2026 and subsequently maintained by the participating Digital Humanities centres in Austria.\
A central element is the development of a robust **governance model**, designed collaboratively by all partner institutions. The infrastructure is distributed across locations, with each partner institution covering ongoing operational costs such as system administration, energy, and facilities. This model ensures independence and sustainability beyond the project’s duration.\
Another key focus is the establishment of a **coordination office** that will oversee the transition of the governance structure from 2026 onwards and ideally operate from 2027 as a permanent service unit within CLARIAH-AT. This office will serve as a central contact point for infrastructure access, administration, and documentation of the processes developed within the project.\
DH-Infra.at is closely linked to other national and international Digital Humanities projects, including the portal [digitale-edition.at](https://www.digitale-edition.at/) (KONDE) for digital scholarly editions and the research infrastructure project [DiTAH project](https://www.ditah.at/) (Digital Transformation of Austrian Humanities).

Various partner institutions are involved, including the University of Graz (project lead), the University of Innsbruck, the University for Continuing Education Krems, the University of Salzburg, the University of Vienna, the University of Applied Arts Vienna, the Technical University of Vienna, the Austrian Academy of Sciences and the Austrian National Library.
