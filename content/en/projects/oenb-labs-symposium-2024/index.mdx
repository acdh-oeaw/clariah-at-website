The ÖNB Labs Symposium 2024 focused on the theme *“Newspapers as Datasets”*. Historical newspapers are among the most sought-after collection materials in memory institutions and offer a wide range of entry points for research, teaching, and an interested public. The symposium continued the long-standing tradition of ÖNB Labs Symposia and provided a platform to discuss current developments in the Digital Humanities, particularly in the area of “Collections as Data.” In addition to scholarly exchange, the event also celebrated the five-year anniversary of ÖNB Labs.
