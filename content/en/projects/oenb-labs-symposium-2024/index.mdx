As demonstrated by the Austrian National Library Labs, the [ÖNB Labs](/consortium/austrian-national-library/), GLAM Labs (Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums) have become established as a service within institutions that work with cultural heritage data. Alongside this development, an international community has emerged that regularly creates new cultural heritage objects and assets in the form of data, tools, and educational resources. This greatly benefits multidisciplinary research, particularly in the field of digital humanities, which is also a key focus for the CLARIAH-AT consortium partners. The respective labs encourage experimentation and discovery, and the exhibition of digital artworks, for anyone interested. A public symposium raises awareness of issues in digital humanities, data science and computer science. Two of the most important points from the CLARIAH-AT and DARIAH [guidelines and visions](https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:clariah.dha-strategie-2021), ‘Training and Education’ and ‘Communities’, are at the heart of our symposium plan, as such an event contributes directly to cultivating the knowledge society.

The ÖNB Labs Symposium 2024 focused on the theme *“Newspapers as Datasets”*. Historical newspapers are among the most sought-after collection materials in memory institutions and offer a wide range of entry points for research, teaching, and an interested public. The symposium continued the long-standing tradition of ÖNB Labs Symposia and provided a platform to discuss current developments in the Digital Humanities, particularly in the area of “Collections as Data.” In addition to scholarly exchange, the event also celebrated the five-year anniversary of ÖNB Labs.

## Project Information

[The event](/events/onb-labs-symposium-newspapers-as-datasets/) took place on 25 and 26 November 2024 at the Austrian National Library, bringing together more than 70 participants from Austria and abroad, including 17 speakers from renowned international institutions. Four diverse thematic panels explored technological innovations and artificial intelligence, infrastructural perspectives, ethical considerations, and practice-oriented projects working with historical newspapers as datasets. The aim was to foster international exchange, integrate multidisciplinary perspectives, and inspire sustainable and ethically informed research.
