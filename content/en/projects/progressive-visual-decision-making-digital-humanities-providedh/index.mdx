The PROgressive VIsual DEcision-Making in Digital Humanities (PROVIDEDH) project is a four-year project funded within the CHIST-ERA call 2016 for the topic "Visual Analytics for Decision Making under Uncertainty - VADMU." The project aims to give Digital Humanities (DH) scholars a space to explore and assess the completeness and evolution of digital research objects, the degree of uncertainty that the models applied to the data incorporate, and to share their perspectives and insights with the project's broad range of stakeholders.

The project's goal is realizable through the development of a wide spectrum of outcomes, ranging from recommendations and reports, to a multimodal collaborative platform for the progressive visual analysis of different DH collections, both for scholars and citizen humanists. The project brings technical experts together with leading digital humanists with a range of expertise and is supported by Winnovation, one of the leading European consulting agencies on Open Innovation. The developed systems will be available for external stakeholders to use and our open-source approach will promote their collaboration with the project and its partners.

The Austrian Partners (exploration space) explore the potentials of Open Innovation in Science along Sustainability Transition and Collaborative Citiy Making under Uncertaintites on the example of Algorithms.

PROVIDEDH is a demonstrator for the Open Innovation Research Infrastructure at exploration space.

Project partner are the university of Salamanca (PI), Ars Electronica Research Institute knoweldge for humanity, exploration space at the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Supercomputing Centre Poznan, and Trinity College Dublin.
