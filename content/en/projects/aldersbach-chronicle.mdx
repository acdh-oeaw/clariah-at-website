The Cistercian monastery of Aldersbach was one of the most important monasteries in Bavaria. A rich tradition of archival records allows a comprehensive reconstruction of the history of the monastery from its foundation in 1146 until its dissolution in 1803. A central source of this tradition is the German-language chronicle of Abbot Gerhard Hörger (r. 1651-1659), edited here for the first time.

The edition consists of a digital humanities treatment of a 137-page manuscript from the mid-17th century, which is now kept in the Bavarian Main State Archives in Munich. In addition to a scholarly introduction, the websites offer a semantically enriched digital edition of Hörger's chronicle in a synoptic view in which the transcription and illustrations of the original source are juxtaposed.
