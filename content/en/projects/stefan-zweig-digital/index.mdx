_Stefan Zweig digital_ (SZD) is an information and research portal dedicated to the life and work of the Austrian writer Stefan Zweig.

At the heart of the project is the reconstruction of Stefan Zweig's posthumous papers, dispersed over the globe. To this end, the copious holdings of Zweig's manuscripts in the Literature Archive Salzburg, the Daniel A. Reed Library, State University of New York at Fredonia, and the National Library of Israel have been indexed throughout, in many cases including digital facsimiles. This growing database is complemented by the catalogue of Zweig's library, comprising all traceable books that Zweig collected at various locations during the course of his life. Stefan Zweig's autograph collection, one of the most important collections of his time, is also accessible online.

SZD boasts not only extensive search facilities, but also special feature pages that concentrate on single topics.

The international project is developed on the initiative of the Literature Archive Salzburg. All other institutions as well as private collections are invited to contribute records and images of their own holdings and so to help expand this information and research network.
