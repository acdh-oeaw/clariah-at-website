The journalistic-literary genre of the "Spectators" or moral weeklies, which surfaced in England at the beginning of the 18th century, soon spread throughout Europe before becoming an important indicator of the Enlightenment discourse system.

The Spectators were aimed primarily at a broad urban readership. These writings were intended to disseminate the ideas and values of the Enlightenment in an entertaining manner. In this way, they were also instrumental in shaping the public opinion process.

The project aims to create a central collection for all European Spectator periodicals. The texts are encoded according to the standard of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) and, in addition to the original text structure, topics, entities (persons, places and works) as well as forms of representation and narration (allegory, dream, utopia, etc.) are recorded. Currently, a total of almost 4000 Spanish, Italian, French, German, English and Portuguese texts are available. They are presented in two views: one that imitates the original and one analysis view.
