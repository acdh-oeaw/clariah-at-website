title: Computer Vision for Digital Humanists
summary: Computer Vision for Digital Humanities has become a very relevant skill
  for many, yet accessible instruction for an audience without a background in
  computer science remains scarce.

Computer Vision has become a very relevant skill for many Digital Humanists, but it is hard to distinguish how we can best budget our time and efforts to engage with this new technology. This workshop will provide a conceptual introduction to the processes involved, coupled with hands-on exercises that focus on the ways that we, as humanists, can curate content and manage metadata to make the best use of new tools available.

The project has filled a significant gap in the field of Digital Humanities by providing highly sought after resources for those interested in incorporating Computer Vision in their research. The teaching materials, along with the winter school, provide the necessary springboard for scholars and students to gain expertise in Computer Vision and Distant Viewing, a skill that has become increasingly relevant as a paradigm and visual turn in the Digital Humanities in recent years. The project outcomes have the potential to significantly transform how Digital Humanists approach their work, taking visual sources (which are said to have long been neglected in DH in favour of text-based data) into account and enabling them to tackle more complex projects with a better understanding of the technologies involved.
