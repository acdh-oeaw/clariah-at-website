#DesignForEmergency was started at the Center for Design / NEW as a global collaborative project with the aim of addressing the COVID19 crisis in a participatory manner and uniting it under a Design for Health initiative. The exploration space coordinates the Austrian participation from data acquisition to data analysis and conceptual data preparation. Co-design challenges are proclaimed and innovation workshops are implemented in order to co-design the necessary products and services that should contribute to better management of a crisis using the example of COVID19. In the first half of 2021, school workshops will be implemented in cooperation with the BMBWF and PULS4. The project was listed as part of the "Ars Eletronica Garden of ... knowledge for humanity" for the DH Award 2020 in the category "Best use of DH for Public Engagement".

Design4Emergency AT acts as a demonstrator of the Open Innovation Research Infrastructure.
