The three-diversity movement aims to implement the UNESCO declaration of diversity through the development of an innovation ecosystem and to contribute to the achievement of Agenda2030 along the SDGs.

In the course of the movement, the Biocultural Diversity Index was developed, as well as the Biocultural Manifesto.

The movement is a demonstrator of the Open Innovation Research Infrastructure at exploration space.
