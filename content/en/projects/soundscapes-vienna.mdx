Stimulating public interest in soundscapes was the main aim of the multilateral project "[European Acoustic Heritage](http://europeanacousticheritage.eu/)" (EAH, 2011-2013, co-financed by the EU, EACEA-P5-Culture Unit, Culture Programme 2007-2013, Strand 1.2.1). In the course of this project, audio recordings of Vienna's urban soundscape (dating from 1981â€“1983) were made accessible online by the Phonogrammarchiv. The integration of their geo-coordinates enables direct selection of the recordings from the [online catalogue](http://catalog.phonogrammarchiv.at/ui/miha/sessions.php?vonBis=0-9&gList_1=projekt&gWert_1=1158&gList_2=&gList_2_op=und&gList_2_opstrict=on&sortieren=signatur&action=uebersicht) via the project's [European Soundscape Map](http://map.europeanacousticheritage.eu/). In addition, the Phonogrammarchiv also made a new set of reference recordings; this re-study used surround recording technique accompanied by video documentation. Selected surround recordings have been released on a DVD, produced by the Phonogrammarchiv and offering also video interviews on sound and acoustic heritage as well as an offline version of the EAH website (including the written research [publication](http://europeanacousticheritage.eu/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/EuropeanAcousticHeritage_web31.pdf), didactic and other material).
