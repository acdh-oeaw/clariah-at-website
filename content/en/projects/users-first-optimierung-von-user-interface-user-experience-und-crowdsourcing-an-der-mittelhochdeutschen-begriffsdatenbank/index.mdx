The [**Middle High German Conceptual Database (MHDBDB)**](https://mhdbdb.sbg.ac.at/#/) is a key digital resource for the study of Middle High German language and literature. Since its creation in the 1990s, it has supported researchers worldwide in the analysis and evaluation of historical texts. With financial support from CLARIAH-AT, the database has undergone a comprehensive modernization: in addition to a new user interface, it has been migrated to an **RDF-based data structure**, ensuring sustainable use and connectivity within the **Semantic Web**.\
The **“Users First”** project builds [on this relaunch](projects/digital-sustainability-relaunch-mhdbdb/) with the goal of further enhancing the accessibility, user-friendliness, and reach of the MHDBDB—in line with the FAIR principles and the Open Science strategy of the Digital Humanities.

## Project Information

The project focuses on four key areas of work:

1. **Optimization of User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI)**\
   Planned improvements include a personalized login area, extended search and download options, note-taking and commenting functions, and accessible design for different devices. Power users will have tools for complex live SPARQL queries and automated data processes. In addition, the platform will be translated into English to reach an international user base.
2. **Crowdsourcing and Knowledge Transfer**\
   A newly developed browser-based crowdsourcing tool will actively involve the community in data collection. Users will be able to annotate texts, verify automatically generated data, or contribute complex morphological analyses. The collected data will be made available as open research data and will also feed into innovative applications such as the *ParzivAI* chatbot.
3. **Technical Support and Project Management**\
   A dedicated part-time position will coordinate project progress, ensure communication among all participants, and facilitate smooth operations.
4. **Sustainable RDF Integration**\
   In the long term, MHDBDB data will be integrated into a trusted repository such as the [**Humanities Asset Management System (GAMS)**](https://gams.uni-graz.at/) at the University of Graz to ensure interoperability and long-term availability.

Through these measures, the MHDBDB will be further developed not only technically and functionally but also strengthened as an open, collaborative, and future-oriented platform in the Digital Humanities.
