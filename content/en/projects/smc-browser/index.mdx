[SMC-Browser](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/acdh/tools/smc-browser/) is a web application developed in the context of CLARIN. It allows to explore the data-space of the [Component Metadata Infrastructure](http://clarin.eu/cmdi), a framework for harmonized creation and publication of language resources descriptions (metadata).

It visualizes the growing number of Profiles, Components and Elements defined within CMDI and their semantic grounding in the data categories of [ISOcat](http://www.isocat.org/). As such, it targets the data modellers of projects, concerned with the task of developing new or reusing existing metadata schemas. It enables them to gain a better overview of the existing CMD Components and their usage, thus helping to foster reuse and to prevent the component proliferation.
