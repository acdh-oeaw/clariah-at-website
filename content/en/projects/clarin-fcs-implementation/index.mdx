The project **“Unlocking the full potential of textual resources – Application of FAIR data principles through CLARIN Federated Content Search Implementation”** aims to significantly enhance the findability and accessibility of Austrian textual resources for research and teaching. At the [**Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities (ACDH)**](/consortium/austrian-academy-of-sciences/), extensive digital text collections are produced in the fields of linguistics, literary studies, and scholarly editions. These datasets are archived in the [**ARCHE**](https://arche.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/browser/) repository and are already searchable at the metadata level via the **CLARIN network**. By implementing the [**CLARIN Federated Content Search (FCS)**](https://www.clarin.eu/content/content-search), it will soon be possible to perform full-text searches across distributed data collections – an important step towards applying the FAIR data principles (Findable, Accessible) in the Austrian context.

## Project Information

The project involves the technical implementation of a full-text search engine at the ACDH-CH, integration with the CLARIN FCS, and embedding the service into the **CLARIAH-AT website**. The FCS allows users to search various text resources hosted at different locations from a central access point – both for keywords and more complex patterns (e.g., collocations). It supports different data formats and linguistic annotations.\
The work plan includes selecting suitable textual resources for the test and final phases, implementing and testing the FCS endpoint, developing workflows for integrating new resources, and creating documentation for other consortium partners. Presentations are planned at the [**CLARIN Conference 2025**](https://www.clarin.eu/event/2025/clarin-annual-conference-2025) and the [**Österreichischen Linguistiktagung**](/events/drittes-oesterreichisches-treffen-zur-digitalen-linguistik-oelt-2025/) (Austrian Linguistics Conference), along with a publication in the CLARIN Conference Proceedings. The project outcomes – including source code and documentation – will be made available in a public repository.

This project introduces new usage scenarios, particularly in higher education, and enhances the international visibility of Austrian data infrastructures. Funding has a direct impact on making sustainable improvements to the digital research landscape, strengthening competitiveness in a European context.
