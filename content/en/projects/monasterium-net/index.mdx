In our virtual archive, you can access a content of more than 600,000 charters from more than 100 European archives. A large portion ot the charters are represented as image, the vast majorty with descriptive metadata and a smaller subset with full transcriptions.
The documents are organized in [archival fonds](https://www.monasterium.net/mom/fonds) and [research collections](https://www.monasterium.net/mom/collections). The content of the virtual archive depends on the decisions of the participants. It can vary from archive to archive, from collection to collection. [Registered](http://www.monasterium.net/mom/registration) users have the possibility to take a greater part in the collaborative effort by working with the sources themselves.

The project offers a data creation environment dedicated to charter description ([Charters Encoding Initiative / CEI](http://www.cei.lmu.de/)) with a web based XML editor ("EditMOM"). It is used in several research project as a platform for collaborative data creation and publication of research results (see [Power and Diplomacy. The Illuminated Charter in France 1160–ca. 1420](https://digital-humanities.at/en/dha/s-project/power-and-diplomacy-illuminated-charter-france-1160-ca-1420), for instance).

The project is maintained by [ICARus](https://www.icar-us.eu/), an international association of archives and research institutes.
