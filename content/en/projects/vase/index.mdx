The Visual Archive South Eastern Europe (VASE) of the Institute for Southeast European History collects and analyses photographs and postcards from the Balkans (1860-1950).The main objective of the Visual Archive Southeastern Europe is to assemble historical and contemporary visual materials on Southeastern Europe. VASE seeks to draw attention to the visual as primary source, to enhance visual studies as a technique and method and thereby enrich the primarily text-based historical-anthropological research. By providing different types of images - e. g. photos and postcards - VASE aims at reflecting the (self-) images of Southeastern Europe, both among the academic community as well as on society at large.
