With the project **“Data Analysis in the ÖNB Labs”**, the **Austrian National Library (ÖNB)** is expanding its digital services for research, education, and the broader public. At the heart of the project are **Jupyter Notebooks (JNBs)** – interactive tools for data analysis, visualization, and modeling. These tools open new possibilities for **innovative Digital Humanities projects** while strengthening **networking and skills development** within the Austrian **CLARIAH-AT network**.

## **About the Project**

The CLARIAH-AT-funded project ‘Data Analysis in the ÖNB Labs’ has been running at the Austrian National Library since April 2025. A software developer is carrying out the project in collaboration with the [ÖNB Labs](https://labs.onb.ac.at/en/) team, with the aim of fundamentally revising and expanding the range of Jupyter Notebooks (JNBs) available on the Labs website.

To this end, some existing JNBs will be updated and new ones developed, primarily to facilitate work with newer datasets and encourage experimentation.

At the start of the project, an evaluation of the requirements and practices relating to JNBs was carried out within the Austrian National Library and in collaboration with the CLARIAH-AT consortium partner institutions. This evaluation provides the basis for adapting the existing JNB offering in the [ÖNB Labs GitLab](https://labs.onb.ac.at/gitlab/explore/projects/topics/CLARIAH-AT) and for expanding it to include new data sets and tools.

The project pursues two main objectives: **innovation in data analysis** and **accessible digital tools**.

* **Expanding the portfolio**: At least ten new Jupyter Notebooks will be developed to support different data types, including text, images, and catalog metadata.
* **Practical functionalities**: From text analysis using machine learning to object detection in historical photographs, the notebooks offer a broad range of real-world applications.
* **User-friendly access**: A clear user guide and integration with **Google Colab** make it easy for beginners to start analyzing data right away – with optional scalable computing power for advanced use cases.
* **Community integration**: A needs assessment within the Digital Humanities community and a hands-on workshop at the end of the project ensure that the tools are relevant and practical.
* **Sustainability**: All materials will remain available through the **ÖNB Labs platform** and its **GitLab repository**, supporting research, education, and individual projects in the long term.

This project delivers **value on multiple levels**: It enhances the international visibility of Austria’s Digital Humanities landscape, supports innovative research initiatives, and promotes digital skills development for a diverse user community.
