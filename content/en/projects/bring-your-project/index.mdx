[ONB Labs](https://www.onb.ac.at/en/research/oenb-lab) provide a web platform to investigate, experiment, and work creatively with digital objects and metadata of the Austrian National Library. For software projects that make use of these services, "Bring your Project" offers support by providing access to digitised content and technical expertise. As a result, for each project new generally usable tools will be made available to the public as open access software. This way, the reuse of digitised collections of the Austrian National Library will be promoted.
