Machine Learning is gaining increasing importance in the Digital Humanities, particularly in the field of digital scholarly editions. The [*Summer School:* *Machine Learning for Digital Scholarly Editions*](/news/cfp-summerschool2025/) builds on the international conference [“Machine Learning and Data Mining for Digital Scholarly Editions”](https://www.i-d-e.de/conference-machine-learning-and-data-mining-for-digital-scholarly-editions/) (University of Rostock, 2022) and addresses students and researchers working at the intersection of Digital Humanities and AI technologies. Its goal is to combine theoretical foundations with practical application, thereby unlocking the potential of machine learning methods for historical text editions.

## Project Information

The one-week Summer School is organized by the **Center for Information Modelling** at the [University of Graz](/consortium/university-of-graz/) in cooperation with [**Know Center**](https://www.know-center.at/)**&#x20;Research GmbH Graz** and the **Institute for Documentology and Scholarly Editing ([IDE](https://www.i-d-e.de/))**. The program combines lectures with practical hands-on sessions and covers the basics of classical ML models (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, support vector machines) as well as state-of-the-art transformer models (e.g., BERT, GPT). Topics such as pattern recognition, transcription (HTR/OCR), text modeling, enrichment, and analysis are taught in a hands-on manner.\
A key feature is the “train-the-trainer” approach: participants are equipped to integrate the acquired methods into their own teaching practice. In addition to lectures and tutorials, a keynote by an internationally renowned scholar will be part of the program. Networking will be fostered through social evening events and excursions.\
All teaching materials – including concise introductory videos, presentation slides, and code notebooks – will be made openly accessible via GitHub and [**DARIAH-Campus**](https://campus.dariah.eu/), ensuring sustainable use beyond the in-person event.
