title: "Digital Edition Creation Pipelines: Tools and Transitions"
summary: The goal of the project is to create best practice guidelines and
  tutorials for the transitions between selected tools that are frequently used
  in digital editing.  These tutorials and guidelines will be realised as an
  extension of the KONDE Weißbuch.

Digital editions are a key area of the Digital Humanities and allow sources to be made available to the scholarly community. Edition Projects involve the acquisition, annotation, enrichment, and publication of source material and transform them into research data. They include textual, visual, and potentially quantitative data and often require customised user interfaces to represent domain-specific research questions. Although each edition project has its own specific requirements, individual steps can be identified that are necessary across projects. In summary, these steps are: transcription and management of images and text, transformation of transcribed text into textual structures (paragraphs, headings etc.) expressed as XML/TEI, modelling of relevant text phenomena, annotation of semantic information and named entities and creation of indices, creation of FAIR data and publication including a web representation. Each step employs different methods and tools.

The goal of the project is to create best practice guidelines and tutorials for the transitions between selected tools (e.g. Transkribus, From The Page, Ediarum, LAKomp, GAMS, TEI Publisher), as well as training materials focusing on the tools themselves. These tutorials and guidelines will be realised as an extension of the [KONDE Weißbuch](https://www.digitale-edition.at/), tools and scripts will be published on GitHub. The resources will also be integrated into the respective community infrastructures (e.g. [DARIAH Campus](https://campus.dariah.eu/)). This ensures that future edition projects can easily and efficiently plan their customised workflows. Common tools can thus be evaluated and improved with respect to their requirements, as well as how they can better interact with other tools.
