The goal of the ÖAW go!digital 2.0 project "Ambraser Heldenbuch: Transcription and Scientific Dataset" is to transcribe the _Ambraser Heldenbuch_ (Vienna, Austrian National Library, Cod. Ser. nova 2663), a text from the early 16th century, in its entirety and to provide a scientific dataset online as well as offline by 2019, which is the 500th anniversary of Emperor Maximilian I's death. The _Ambraser Heldenbuch_ was commissioned by Emperor Maximilian I at the beginning of the 16th century as a luxury manuscript and was written in one hand by Hans Ried, a tax collector from Bolzano, on approximately 250 large-format parchment folios. Twenty-five of the most important Middle High German texts can be found in this luxury codex (e.g. _Nibelungenlied_, _Helmbrecht_, etc.), of which fifteen are unique to the _Ambraser Heldenbuch_ (e.g. _Erec_, _Mauritius von Cra__ûn_, etc.).

Due to the large amount of text by a single writer – the _Ambraser Heldenbuch_ and four further documents known to be by Hans Ried (certificate, toll record, service records), comprising 500,000 words – the transcription of the entire Ried autograph is well-suited to be a unique linguistic and literary corpus:

1.  From a philological standpoint regarding editions, the planned corpus offers unique possibilities for the reconstruction of unique Middle High German texts which have been handed down only in the _Ambraser Heldenbuch_, as well as for editions and the study of parallel traditions (e.g. _Nibelungenlied_).
2.  From a linguistic and dialectological point of view, the transcription of the _Ambraser Heldenbuch_ in combination with other documents by Hans Ried makes available a large, geographically liminal corpus poised at the transition from the Middle Ages to the early modern period, produced by a single writer.

Regarding editions, historical linguists and philologists have long perceived the transcription of the entire _Ambraser Heldenbuch_, and more specifically the Ried autograph, as an important desideratum of research. Thus, the goal of the ÖAW go!digital project is an elaborate state-of-the-art transcription of the entire _Ambraser Heldenbuch_ (in combination with some shorter texts by Ried) as well as an edition of this transcription to be a data set that is citable by and accessible to the public and can serve as a reference work for a wide spectrum of research.
