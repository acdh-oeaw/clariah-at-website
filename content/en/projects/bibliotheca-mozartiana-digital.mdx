The Bibliotheca Mozartiana of the Mozarteum Foundation, Salzburg, holds an important historical collection, which goes back to gifts from the widow and the sons of Wolfgang Amadé Mozart. Among them are the world’s largest collection of letters from the Mozart family, many autographs and other music manuscripts, first and early editions of works by Mozart and his son Franz Xaver Wolfgang, as well as historical publications about Mozart and his environment. These are accessible for free, and linked with the Digital Mozart Edition and other research projects.

As many historical holdings in libraries and archives are already digitized, a challenge for the future is the linking of the digitized sources with the research, which is based on these sources. The sources are cataloged according to current research standards within the Austrian Library Network and the International Inventory of Musical Sources RISM. In Bibliotheca Mozartiana digital, these metadata are merged within a uniform interface. There are also links to editions, which were published as a part of the Digital Mozart Edition, such as the project Mozart Letters and Documents – Online Edition.
