This project was developed in 2020 to visualise the range of digital projects developed and promoted by museums during the COVID-19 lockdowns. The map presents the digital projects, either added by the researched or directly added by museums through the dedicated form. These projects are organised by broad categories, such as "contemporary collecting", "virtual tours", "online collections", "games", "educational content", "streaming content". Each datapoint presents a short description and a link to the relevant museum webpage.

The map currently lists around 820 projects from over 40 countries worldwide - and data are being regularly added.
