Get inspired by digital humanities!

In recent years, digital methods have opened up completely new horizons for research. In September 2024, the *CLARIAH-AT Summer School* will therefore take place at the <Link link={{ discriminant: "consortium", value: "university-of-salzburg" }}>Paris Lodron University of Salzburg</Link>, where you will have the opportunity to get to know the processing of text and image sources with the help of innovative tools:

At the beginning, we will come into direct contact with the material basis during ***excursions*** to the archives of the [Erzdiözese Salzburg](https://eds.at/archiv/home) and the [Hohensalzburg Fortress](https://www.salzburg-burgen.at/de/festung-hohensalzburg/).

On ***two practical days***, you will be able to get hands-on and experiment with DH tools together with researchers from the fields of history, German studies and art history.

On the ***expert day***, you will be given an overview of the various methods, tools and possible applications. On the last day, you can be inspired by a wide range of DH projects at the CLARIAH roadshow.

Join the research community!
