We are pleased to welcome **Christian Steiner** and **Christopher Pollin** as speakers who will introduce you to XSLT in the Digital Humanities.

XSL (Extensible Stylesheet Language) and X-technologies are well established technologies in the digital humanities as a lot of data is available in XML: the standard of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) is based on XML as well as many metadata standards for the description, administration and long-term archiving of data that focus on XML. Many systems offer the option of using XML as an import or export format, and XML is usually the basic format for the web frontend required to implement digital editions.

In the course of the workshop, which will be held onsite only and in German language, an introduction to the programming language XSL will be given. The following learning objectives are targeted:

* Setting up an (XSL)-transformation scenario in Oxygen XML Editor

* Setting up and implementing an XSL transformation from XML/TEI to HTML (with Bootstrap 5)

* Get to know and apply simple XPath expressions

* Get to know and apply the following program structures in XSL:

  * xsl:apply-templates
  * xsl:call-template
  * xsl:if und xsl:choose
  * XPath Operators
  * XPath functions and XSLT-specific additions to XPath
    * format-date(), substring-after(), concat(), sum(), document() etc.
  * xsl:for-each, xsl:for-each-group
  * xsl:result-document

The workshop is planned in the sense of blended learning. Input is provided via screencasts and the classroom session focuses on hands-on exercises. The focus is on a very pragmatic approach. The main goal is not to convey theoretical concepts, but to provide an introduction to simple transformation scenarios with XSL.
