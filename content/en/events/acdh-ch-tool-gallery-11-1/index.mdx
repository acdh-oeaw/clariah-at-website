This workshop offers a comprehensive introduction to the world of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLM), with a special focus on prompt engineering. In an era where AI technologies are increasingly gaining importance, this workshop aims to equip participants with the necessary knowledge and skills to effectively utilize and optimize these technologies. \
 \
The event pursues three main objectives: 

1. Imparting a fundamental understanding of generative AI and LLM, including their technical foundations and application possibilities. 
2. Introduction to the core concepts of prompt engineering. 
3. Learning strategies and best practices for creating effective prompts that optimize the performance of LLM. 

 \
In terms of content, the workshop covers a broad spectrum, including: 

* Principles of prompt engineering, illustrated through practical examples 
* Advanced concepts such as Chain of Thought, Zero and Few Shot Prompting 
* Techniques for structuring prompts, including templates and custom instructions 
* Application-oriented examples, such as planning workshops, simulating panel discussions, and creating course outlines
