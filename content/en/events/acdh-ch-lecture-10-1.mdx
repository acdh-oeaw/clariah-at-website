**Digital Linguistics**

Digital Linguistics is a growing interdisciplinary field at the crossroads of traditional linguistics, information technology and social sciences. Rather than focusing on the use of computers for performing language-related tasks (such as machine translation or voice recognition), Digital Linguistics analyses, preserves and disseminates language data, i.e. digital artefacts that use language as a means of human expression. Closely related to Digital Humanities, Digital Linguistics is attracting increasing attention from the academic community as well as the public and private sectors, since skills in handling digital language data are considered essential in the modern economy and society. The lecture will discuss the short history of Digital Linguistics, its relation with other disciplines such as Digital Humanities and Computational Linguistics, as well as current and future challenges.
