Founder, Institute for Digital Heritage

**Contextualizing Museum Data: Digitization, Infrastructure and digital Literacy**

The lecture focuses on three main processes that are important to contextualize when exploring digital material in and from museums:

Digitization: A brief introduction on the social localities of data production, a brief history of digitization and an introduction to roles that interact with data in the museum context shows the consequent data diversity in the museum space. Infrastructure for data storage, management and publishing cultural heritage data is a second context for differing standards, structures and systems. In order to decipher and comprehend digital material in the context of museums this lecture will argue that a human machine interaction depends on a field specific digital literacy.

The contextualization will give an overview of the various forms, formats and processes of digital material in museums and opens an awareness of possibilities to work with data. Dr. Luther will show her current project *[Digital Benin](https://digital-benin.org/)* as a tangible example of a unique digital project that brings together information about objects from over 120 museums world wide.

Please **[RSVP for the onsite-lecture / register for the online-lecture](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/acdh/events/registration/acdh-ch-lecture-84).**
