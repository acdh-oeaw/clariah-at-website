**Exploring the Boundaries:**\
**The Present and Future of AI-powered Handwritten Text Recognition**

The ACDH-CH lecture 9.1 will provide an overview of the current state of AI-powered multilingual Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR). Dr Rabus will discuss the capabilities and limitations of HTR models for different scripts and languages, with a special focus on 'smart' models that have enhanced capabilities such as resolving abbreviations or transliterating text into another script. Additionally, this insightful lecture will examine the implications of mass digitization enabled by HTR technologies for humanities research in the digital age, and provide examples of how to work with HTRized text corpora.
