**Workshop on the topic of "*Interface* of Medieval Studies" ("Schnittstelle Mediävistik") within the framework of the DFG "Network Open Middle Ages" ("[Netzwerk offenes Mittelalter](https://offenesmittelalter.org/)") on Linked Open Data (LOD).**

As an *interface*, medieval studies mediates between disciplines in a multimedial way, between the digital and the analogue, heterogeneous research objects and diverse methods. In doing so, it not only integrates methods and knowledge from other disciplines, but also contributes to gaining knowledge beyond its own discipline.

**Core topics of the Workshop:**

* Role of interdisciplinarity: on the side of the objects of study, which, depending on the subject disciplines, examine e.g. historical data, literary texts, objects, philological themes, text and image, etc.; on the side of approaches, which, depending on the subject disciplines, use 'traditional' ways of working and computational approaches, annotation, modelling, LOD, etc.
* Mediation position of medieval studies per se, for example through scholarly communication and targeted content marketing.

**Research questions:** To what extent does linked research data promote an interdisciplinary exchange? How can it be achieved that medievalist data also take into account non-text-based disciplines and that subject-specific LOD do not acquire self-referential dynamics?

**Chairs of the Network:** Dr. Luise Borek (TU Darmstadt) and Dr. Katharina Zeppezauer-Wachauer (MHDB|University of Salzburg, Co-Coordinator)
