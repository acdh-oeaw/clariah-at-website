Assistant Professor of East Asian history and digital humanities at the East Asian Institute of Eötvös Loránd (ELTE) University.

**Why does language matter in DH? Multilingual DH as a phenomenon in digital research and infrastructures**

The rapid development of digital humanities has led to the diversification of the field with a wide array of tools and methods. However, linguistic aspects remain a problem in DH practice because most languages beyond English, and particularly non-Latin scripts, are still significantly underrepresented and under-resourced. My talk will discuss the realities and specific challenges of the lifecycle of a multilingual DH project primarily through examples from East Asian studies. These will also serve as case studies pointing at broader issues that multilingual DH as a phenomenon reveals about the importance of language sensitivity, diversity, and equal access in DH. In addition, the presentation will also showcase emerging initiatives aiming at raising awareness of and remedying these challenges in order to reorient Anglo- and West-centric aspects towards a more inclusive DH field.
