Students and doctoral candidates need practical skills in the field of artificial intelligence in order to actively shape the future of research. However, access to interdisciplinary projects that combine historical data with AI technologies is often limited. This is exactly where our workshop steps in!

#### What can be expected?  

* **Practical Experience:**&#x41;pplication of AI to historical data using the practical examples of the MHDBDB (University of Salzburg) and the LLM ParzivAI (University of Heidelberg).

- **Interdisciplinary Exchange:** Collaboration between students and doctoral candidates from Salzburg and Heidelberg to strengthen cooperation between the data-driven medieval studies programmes at both universities.

* **Cross-disciplinary skills:** Acquisition of skills in digital humanities, medieval studies and computer science.

- **Insight into research:** Understanding how AI-supported data analysis works and what potential it offers.

* **Doctoral students at the University of Salzburg are eligible to earn ECTS credits for their doctoral degree.**

#### Programme:  

* **Lecture on AI-Literacy** by Christopher Pollin (Graz/DHCraft): “Trust us, We’are Frontier-LLMs”. Be the Critical-Expert-in-the-Loop: Perspectives on AI Literacy

- **Hackathon:** Joint data analysis with data from the MHDBDB and LLM ParzivAI to discover new insights 

* **Presentation:** Documentation of the results of the joint data analysis  

- **Networking-opportunities:** Exchange and networking for students, doctoral candidates and researchers
