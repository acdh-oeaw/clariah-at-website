### at the University of Vienna in the winter semester of 2023/24

This lecture circuit provides students with a reasonably broad overview of the state of research and working methods in the Digital Humanities. A variety of speakers from different disciplines within the humanities – history, literature, museum studies, art history, archaeology, and more – will discuss what digital methods bring to their own fields, and what they understand the Digital Humanities actually to be.

The lectures will take place weekly, **every** **Tuesday from 4:45 PM – 6:15 PM**, **starting 10.10.2023** in the lecture hall 41, Gerda-Lerner Hauptgebäude (main building of the) University of Vienna, 1st floor, staircase 8 and will be followed by a small reception.

Subject to the consent of the lecturer, the lectures can be followed live at the following Link\
