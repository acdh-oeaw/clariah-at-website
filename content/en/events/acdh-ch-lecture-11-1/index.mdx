The research landscape in cultural heritage is marked by a vast diversity of data, stakeholders, and methods. It spans individual scholars, creative practitioners, and citizen scientists, as well as public and private organisations, GLAM institutions, research institutes, and universities. Amidst this diversity lies a challenging wealth of data.\
\
This talk focuses on current approaches to integrating multimodal research data into distributed, knowledge graph-driven research data infrastructures. Drawing on examples from NFDI4Culture — the consortium for research data on material and immaterial cultural heritage within the German National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI) — we will explore how semantic data integration workflows can be operationalised to create consistent knowledge representations across diverse academic fields.\
\
At the same time, we will examine how semantic retrieval enables richer queries by combining textual, visual, audio, spatial, and temporal data, allowing for holistic data explorations that are particularly valuable in cultural heritage research, where context is paramount.\
\
In concluding, we will focus on how data federation and decentralisation inspired by the Fediverse can serve as useful models for balancing data sovereignty and FAIR data provision across institutions and academic domains.
