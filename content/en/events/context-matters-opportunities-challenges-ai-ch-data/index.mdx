The advances made in the field of machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML) offer a range of opportunities for libraries and digital scholarship. In projects such as [Mensch.Maschine.Kultur](https://staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/die-staatsbibliothek/projekte/project-id-1168-2022), the [Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin - Preußischer Kulturbesitz](https://mmk.sbb.berlin/) (SBB) is developing ML technologies for a wide range of applications: from text and layout recognition and image analysis to information extraction, machine-assisted subject indexing and, last but not least, the provision of collections as data and their digital curation.&#x20;

On the other hand, the historical and cultural contexts must always be taken into account when using ML technologies in combination with historical sources and cultural heritage materials. Collections digitized by libraries are heterogeneous in terms of the period covered, the perspectives, places or regions they contain and the cultural contexts in which they must be placed. Historical documents often contain distortions that no longer correspond to today's ethical values. While historians are trained to classify sources and apply source criticism as a methodological tool, AI systems developed by industry are primarily trained on modern texts from the Internet and cannot do this.&#x20;

Using the example of SBB's experience with machine learning and AI, this talk aims to provide insights into practical applications while at the same time raising awareness for a conscious and responsible approach to ML and cultural heritage data.
