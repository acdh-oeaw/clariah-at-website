How can I publish my digital edition (TEI/XML-encoded text files) online in a stable and sustainable manner, ideally without costs and complex cooperation agreements? The [**DSE-Static-Cookiecutter**](https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/dse-static-cookiecutter) offers an answer to this question.

This is a ‘static site generator’ developed at [ACDH](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/acdh/) and used in a number of digital edition projects, which generates a website from TEI/XML-encoded text files and makes it accessible online via the free GitHub Pages service.

The first part of the ACDH Tool Gallery explains and demonstrates the DSE Static Cookiecutter and the concepts and technologies behind it. In the second part, participants are invited to convert their own TEI/XML data into an online-ready website using the DSE Static Cookiecutter. Several colleagues from the ACDH will be on hand to assist. A sample data set will be provided by the ACDH for those who do not have their own data.

---

Please bring your laptop and, if applicable, your own TEI/XML data.

Please note that there is a limit of 20 participants for the second part of the event.

### **Prerequisites**

* Knowledge of TEI/XML
* XSLT (Oxygen + transformation scenarios), Git
* GitHub user account
* Ideally, you already have your own project in which texts are encoded in TEI/XML that are intended to be published as a digital edition.
