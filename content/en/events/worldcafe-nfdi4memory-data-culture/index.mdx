*As part of the DH Forum of the MV Symposium, the [NFDI4Memory Task Area 5 'Data Culture'](https://4memory.de/task-areas/task-area-5-data-culture/) would like to organise a World Café on 'Historical Research Data' together with the Medievalists' Association.*

*The aim of the event is to collect and discuss the acute problems and needs of working with historical research data and the resulting goals and expectations of research data infrastructures from the community. After a short introduction to the work of NFDI4Memory, the World Café format will be used to discuss proposed topics and questions in 3-4 different discussion groups, e.g. "What are the acute challenges of medieval research data? (keyword 'names') What do research data and data culture mean for medieval studies?", "How and for what do you use data in your research?", "What are your requirements for a good FDI?", etc. It is planned to fill a 90m slot parallel to the structure of the symposium*.

*The format is intended to create added value for several parties. 1. for the work of DHInfra/CLARIAH-AT in the further development and establishment of the Austrian research data infrastructure, 2. as a position statement for the association and the working group Digital Medieval Studies, 3. for the participating medievalists as a forum to communicate and discuss their concerns and thus help shape the infrastructures, and 4. for NFDI4Memory/Task Area 5 to be able to link these concerns of the medievalist community with those of other sub-communities of historical studies*.
