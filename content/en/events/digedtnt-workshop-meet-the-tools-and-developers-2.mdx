Digital editions are a core area of the digital humanities; they make historical sources accessible. Computer-based methods are used for the implementation, dissemination and research of scientifically grounded source publications. Digital editions include textual, visual and, where appropriate, quantitative data and often require specialised user interfaces to address domain-specific research questions. Although each edition project has its own specific requirements, individual steps can be identified that are generally necessary for edition projects. These are, in the broadest sense, the digitisation of the source with the management of images and text, transcription, modelling of relevant text phenomena using adequate mark-up languages, annotation of semantic information and named entities, creation of indices, as well as publication via the web in accordance with FAIR criteria. In recent years, a number of tools have been established for all these steps, which are used with preference.

The aim of the Digital Edition Creation Pipelines: Tools and Transitions (DigEdTnT) project, funded by [*CLARIAH-AT's Funding Call 2022: Interoperability and Reusability of DH Data and Tools*](/en/project-funding/), is to create best practice pipelines and tutorials for selected tools and their transitions to help with tool selection and working with tools to create digital editions. Transitions refer to challenges that arise when, for example, results from *Transkribus* are transferred to *ediarum* for further annotation.

The workshop includes **tool presentations** as well as a **tool dating** that invites to discuss specific use cases with the experts.

The event will be held **hybrid**. No registration is required for online participation, the stream will be freely accessible. For onsite attendance and further information please send an email to christopher.pollin(at)uni-graz.at.
