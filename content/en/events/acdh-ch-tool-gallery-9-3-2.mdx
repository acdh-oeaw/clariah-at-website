[Transkribus](https://readcoop.eu/de/transkribus/) is one of the most popular tools for AI-based automated transcription of manuscripts and prints. Developed at the [University of Innsbruck](/en/consortium/university-of-innsbruck/), users can access various tools and support from the community, which now has well over 150,000 users and is constantly publishing new models, thus making accessible and re-usable research available in the spirit of Open Science. In this Tool Gallery, advanced techniques will be taught in order to be able to use the possibilities of automated text transcription even more efficiently. The focus here will be on the tools for layout training.
