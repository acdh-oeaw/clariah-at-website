Based on working examples, this talk explores how maintaining a focus on robust and simple structures within archaeological information and on ensuring that entities can be linked to each other allows for flexibility in the creation and public presentation of digitized archaeological resources. The examples range from work at Pompeii, at Kenchreai in Greece, in the field of numismatics, and on smaller datasets as part of individual research. This work illustrates the principles of Linked Open Data (LOD) and the Semantic Web, with an emphasis on how these practices support data reuse and reproducible research. One result can be greater interoperability between disparate digital resources on the public internet.
