***Researching the Digital Human with contemporary AI***

This talk will present how we can research the digital human in archives with new digital methodologies in the age of deep learning. Archives have long been a key concern of academic debates about truth, memory, recording and power and are important sites for social sciences and humanities research. These debates have only accelerated with the digital transformation of archives. This talk presents novel methodologies and tools for changing memory and power relations in digital archives through new ways of reassembling marginalised, non-canonical entities in digital archives. I will finish by introducing the plans for my new ERC grant on deep culture, which integrates the critical analysis of contemporary deep learning practices with an attempt to change the methodological direction in the digital humanities.
