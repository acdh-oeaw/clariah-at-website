This CLARIN Café showcases the [SSH Open Marketplace](https://marketplace.sshopencloud.eu/), a **discovery portal** which pools and contextualises resources for Social Sciences and Humanities research communities, and its close connections with the CLARIN infrastructure. \
More specifically, it aims to: \
i) provide an overview of the **types of resources** available on the SSH Open Marketplace, such as tools and services, training materials, datasets, publications and workflows, \
ii) discuss the **challenges and the opportunities** linked to adding CLARIN resources to the SSH Open Marketplace, and \
iii) introduce **the notion of ‘workflow’** and make a **demo** of how workflows are built on the SSH Open Marketplace platform. The presentations will include references to CLARIN **language resources**, and will argue that their registration on the SSH Open Marketplace and their inclusion in workflows increases their added value and reusability potential. 

This CLARIN Café is organised in the framework of a paper entitled **‘The SSH Open Marketplace and CLARIN’**,​​ presented at the CLARIN 2023 Annual Conference and published in its [proceedings](https://office.clarin.eu/v/CE-2023-2328_CLARIN2023_ConferenceProceedings.pdf). The Café will be followed by an [onsite workshop](https://www.clarin.eu/event/2024/creating-clarin-workflow-ssh-open-marketplace-clarin2024) organised at the CLARIN 2024 Annual Conference, which will represent a hands-on session tailored to the CLARIN community about building workflows and implementing them on the SSH Open Marketplace. Participants of the CLARIN Café who also plan to attend the CLARIN 2024 Annual Conference, are invited to register for the workshop, which will give them an opportunity to conceptualise and to implement their own workflows.
