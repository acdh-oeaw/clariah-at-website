## **Programm**

At this meeting, colleagues from the **Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities** at the **Austrian Academy of Sciences** will be our guests, presenting the service [**Vocabs**](https://vocabs.dariah.eu/).

[**Vocabs**](https://vocabs.dariah.eu/) is a service developed by the [**Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities**](/consortium/austrian-academy-of-sciences/) (ACDH) at the Austrian Academy of Sciences in cooperation with the research infrastructure [**DARIAH-EU**](https://www.dariah.eu/). It is available to the broader community of European digital humanities and cultural heritage research.

**Vocabs** provides an easy way to make controlled vocabularies publicly accessible through a searchable web interface. Each vocabulary or concept can be referenced via URIs, and various modelling options within the SKOS data model can be used, including hierarchical relations, alternative labels, mapping relations, and grouping.

However, **Vocabs** is much more than just a browser. The Vocabs team can support vocabulary creators from the initial planning and discussion phase through to the conversion of drafts into SKOS and the creation of semantic links to other resources. The service also includes tools such as the [**Vocabs Editor**](https://vocabs.dariah.eu/en/about#editor), which offers a user-friendly GUI for creating vocabularies, as well as extensive public documentation (including checklists) currently in preparation.

The speakers are **Massimiliano Carloni** and **Martina Trognitz**, both researchers at the Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities of the Austrian Academy of Sciences in Vienna. Their work focuses on the long-term preservation of research data and the application of semantic technologies in the humanities.
