**Where:** Theatersaal, Sonnenfelsgasse 19, 1010 Wien & Online (Zoom)

**Richard Rogers**\
University of Amsterdam

The purpose of the talk is to reintroduce contemporary critiques of social media research, as they have gathered steam following the 'fake news' crisis of 2016 and the Facebook whisteblower's revelations in 2021 concerning how angry posts are privileged. The talk discusses how social media data is used to study cultural and societal trends but have several issues from the quality of the data to platform and proprietary effects. Repurposing platform data for social research is also scrutinised, given how platforms optimise content and entice engagement. Re-using platform dashboards and other non-scientific instrumentaria are also addressed, together with how platforms are resistant to archiving. It concludes with a discussion of the future of social media research employing platform data.
