**When:** Oct 17-Oct 18, 2022

**Where:\
Day 1:** online (Zoom),\
**Day 2:** online (Zoom)

The CLARIAH-AT working group "[Knowledgetransfer](/en/the-clariah-at-working-groups/)" organizes a workshop series on "Train the Trainers" that focuses on delivering training material about Digital Humanities topics. The first event of the series on "Teaching Digital Humanities" is organized in cooperation with [ACDH-CH](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/acdh/) and is part of the [ACDH-CH Tool Gallery Series](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/acdh/events/event-series/acdh-ch-tool-galleries).

In recent years, several academic open access e-learning platforms have been developed. They offer teachers, trainers, students, and young researchers the opportunity to exchange, share, and expand their knowledge in their respective academic fields. These collaborative work forms an important contribution to the development of any academic field.

Yet planning, designing, and producing effective online training materials is a skill that needs to be acquired and trained as well. Our workshop therefore aims at providing researchers, who want to share their expertise online with students, with a toolkit they can easily apply and use in the creation of their (first) online training materials.

This Tool Gallery is an online two-day event.

Please register until **Tuesday, 11.10.2022** latest:

**Preliminary Programme**

### 17.10., DAY 1 (via Zoom)

**Introduction to the world of e-learning and its design (basics, instructional design, learning goals)**

Start ca. 09:30

* 09:30 – 10:00: Introduction, eLearning basics
* 10:00-11:00: Mag. Claudia Hackl (Center for Teaching and Learning, Universität Wien sowie Projektmanagement Open Education Austria Advanced), – "Open Educational Resources kennenlernen"
* In accordance with open-access publications and the publication of research data in open sciene/data contexts, more and more training materials are made available for long-term use. These Open Educational Resources (OER) are publicly available educational resources, which are licenced under creative commons and thus rusable. But what makes an OER an OER? Learn more about synergies in open science and open education in current OER-activities in Austria and the opportunities and tools for OER-production and usage.

- 11:00 – 11:30: Coffee Break
- 11:30-13:00: Isabell Grundschober, MA (University for Continuing Education Krems) – "Design for Learning – Lernressourcen und -aktivitäten lernendenzentriert entwickeln" (+Q\&A)
- Learner centred learning design – what is that?
- The procedure: from prototype to implementation
- Learning design: constructive and feedback loops ensure high quality
- Develop your learning design: learning goals, working with a template, create and reflect on constructive alignment
