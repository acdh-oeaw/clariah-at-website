The paper presented at [DHNB 2024](https://dhnb.eu/conferences/dhnb2024/), *Digital Humanities in the Nordic and Baltic Countries 8th Conference*, discusses best practices in the development and operation of the network of Knowledge centres within the framework of the transnational and cross-disciplinary CLARIN Knowledge Infrastructure. A Knowledge centre is an institution or a collective of institutions which "have agreed to share their knowledge and expertise with others" (Branco et al. 2023), which has been certified by [Common Language Resources and Technology Infrastructure CLARIN](https://www.clarin.eu/), and which has an established website providing the users with information on the offered services and contact forms.\
Currently, there are 28 [Knowledge centres](https://www.clarin.eu/content/knowledge-centres) from different countries covering a wide range of topics, offering various research and training related services and organised as either a virtual centre of one or several institutional partners in one country or distributed across multiple countries.\
This paper aims to present this rich diversity of the research infrastructure and its state-of-the-art by reviewing existing Knowledge centres and their areas of expertise, describing the activities initiated by CLARIN to strengthen K-centre networking, showcasing different types of K-centres, and presenting the operation and collaboration practices shared by K-centres in their annual report for 2022-2023.

The paper *Transnational Research Infrastructure: A Journey Through CLARIN Knowledge Centres* is presented by Jurgita Vaičenonienė (Vytautas Magnus University, Lithuania), and is a joint effort of Michal Kren (Charles University, Prague), Vesna Lušicky (Universität Wien, Wien) and Vincent Vandeghinste (Instituut voor de Nederlandse Taal, Leiden / KU Leuven, Belgium).
