**The CLARIAH-AT Consortium**\
CLARIAH-AT is the consortium of Austrian universities and research institutions that coordinates and drives Austrian activities in the European ESFRI research infrastructures CLARIN (Common Language Resources and Technology Infrastructure) and DARIAH (Digital Research Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities) on behalf of the Austrian Federal Ministry of Education, Science and Research. The consortium brings together Austrian institutions with relevant expertise in research, development and teaching in the field of Digital Humanities as well as in the establishment and sustainable operation of research (data) infrastructures, which also play an active role in the Austrian development of Digital Humanities and the establishment and expansion of technical and social infrastructures for the humanities in general.

In June 2019, the core group of CLARIAH-AT reconstituted itself by signing a consortium agreement between the participating institutions, which was extended indefinitely in March 2021 and now unites the Austrian Academy of Sciences (ÖAW), Austrian National Library (ÖNB), University for Continuing Education Krems, University of Graz, University of Innsbruck, University of Klagenfurt, University of Salzburg, University of Vienna in the consortium.

**The Digital Humanities Austria Strategy 2021+**\
The strategy paper Digital Humanities Austria Strategy 2021+ is based on preliminary work by the consortium and a consultation of the Austrian professional community in the field of Digital Humanities. It defines four guidelines for the future development of Digital Humanities in Austria *as a tentative roadmap*, and serves as a work program for the working groups of the same name:

* Research infrastructures and networks
* Research data and repositories
* Methods, services and tools
* Education, training and knowledge transfer

In the current work period 2021-23, these four working groups are carrying out a diverse program of activities to advance and support the further development of Digital Humanities in Austria. In addition to networking events and workshops, the CLARIAH-AT consortium is particularly committed to promoting DH projects and young scholars.

Another focus of the strategy is building and promoting cooperation between memory and research institutions: CLARIAH-AT hopes to achieve more than simply digital duplication or the mere provision of collections by promoting collaborations which will generate new insights andl open up new possibilities for the (open and accessible) dissemination of cultural heritage.

**Funding**\
CLARIAH-AT has been receiving annual funding from the Austrian Federal Ministry of Education, Science and Research, as well as membership contributions by the institutions forming the consortium.

**Conflict of Interests Disclosure**\
No Conflict of Interests to disclose.
