Digital data and methods are hotly debated in a wide variety of social science fields. The comprehensive digital transformation is also changing research and its questions. Research practices are also undergoing a comprehensive transformation. In view of the new possibilities offered by computer-intensive calculations and the increasingly comprehensive access to a wide variety of 'digital data', methods are being critically reflected: What are the roles of theory or data and research infrastructures that have to deal with an increasingly significant position of private sector actors?\
In the lecture, Katharina Kinder-Kurlanda reports on her experiences in critically approaching digital data and methods, which often demonstrate their potential way beyond the seemingly obvious.
