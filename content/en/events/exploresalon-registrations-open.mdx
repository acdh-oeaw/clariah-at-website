## ExploreSalon 2023: Unveil Hidden Stories from the Past

When people interact, they leave traces: uncountable letters, diaries, chronicles, plaques, and other written records have preserved memories about people – long before the rise of smartphones and social media.

From **May 22nd – May 26th, 2023**, the **ExploreSalon at the ACDH-CH in Vienna** offers a space to explore those digitized memories, seek hidden stories, discuss ideas, share findings and gain innovative insights into storytelling with data:

You may choose from a number of curated biographic, spatial and temporal datasets with focus on Vienna 1900 to play with. Alternatively, you may suggest other datasets or bring your own.

While you engage in the creative process together with your team, mentors offer on-site and online expert consultancy, providing the opportunity for peer feedback and sharing experiences. At the end of the week, you will have the chance to showcase your ideas and share any results with others.
