Developed at the University of Innsbruck, users can draw on various tools and support from the community, which now numbers well over 100,000 users and is constantly publishing new models, thus making accessible and re-usable research available in the spirit of Open Science. In this Tool Gallery, you will learn how to use Transkribus in order to be able to use the possibility of automated text transcription for your documents.
