The [MUSIL ONLINE](https://edition.onb.ac.at/musil/) internet portal aims to provide scholars and other interested individuals with scholarly access to Robert Musil's literary works and posthumous writings. Alongside the complete edition published by Jung und Jung, the portal provides a full range of historical-critical tools.

The central text of Musil's work is now being added to the existing prototype, and *Der* *Mann ohne Eigenschaften* \[The Man without Qualities] can finally be read on MUSIL ONLINE! This novel provides a panoramic view of pre-war Central European society from the perspective of the protagonist Ulrich, who reflects Musil himself.

Alongside the reading text of this important modernist novel, the digital edition offers a direct view of Musil's own handwritten annotations in his first edition (the so-called 'hand copy'). Users can look forward to innovative functions, expanded content and an inspiring reading experience. All Musil enthusiasts in research, teaching and beyond can now immerse themselves in the world of one of the most important authors of the 20th century on MUSIL ONLINE.

The official launch will take place on 17 June 2025 at 11:00 am at the Robert Musil Institute for Literary Research/Carinthian Literature Archive, either on-site at Bahnhofstraße 50, 9020 Klagenfurt am Wörthersee (event hall, 1^(st) floor) or online via: [https://classroom.aau.at/b/mad-z9x-8wy-cvr](https://classroom.aau.at/b/mad-z9x-8wy-cvr)
