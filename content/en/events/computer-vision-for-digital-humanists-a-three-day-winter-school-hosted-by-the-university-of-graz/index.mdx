**Call for Participation**

**When:** 8. – 10.2.2023

**Where:** University of Graz

**Registration:** sean.winslow\[at]uni-graz.at

Computer Vision has become a very relevant skill for many Digital Humanists, but it is hard to distinguish how we can best budget our time and efforts to engage with this new technology. This workshop will provide a conceptual introduction to the processes involved, coupled with hands-on exercises that focus on the ways that we, as humanists, can curate content and manage metadata to make the best use of new tools available.

No advanced mathematics or computer science are presumed, but participants should be comfortable working with the Python command line (e.g., Anaconda) and running Jupyter notebooks.

**Workshop Schedule**

The workshop is made up of six 3-hour sessions (half lecture, half practicum) over the course of three days. Each day will be split between theoretical and practical sessions, with hands-on exercises designed to explore the topics of the day.

**Wednesday**\
Machine learning/Computer Vision fundamentals: what do we mean when we talk about machine learning, and how do computers 'see'?

**Thursday**\
DH data management for Computer Vision: how can we, as digital humanists, prepare our data for better results in Computer Vision workflows?

**Friday**\
Applications of Computer Vision: how are projects using Computer Vision in the humanities and what does that that actually entail?

Parts of the workshop may be filmed for instructional purposes\
Coffee, snacks, and lunches will be provided.

**How to apply**

To be considered for participation in this workshop please submit a 1 page CV and letter of interest (1 page max.) addressing the following:

• Why are you interested in attending this workshop?\
• How will the skills learned improve your scholarship?\
• What is your academic background and research specialization?\
• Do you have access to funding for travel to Graz and accommodation?
