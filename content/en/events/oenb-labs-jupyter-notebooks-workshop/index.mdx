We are delighted to invite you to the upcoming [**ONB Labs**](https://labs.onb.ac.at/en/)**&#xA0;Jupyter Notebooks Workshop**! 

In this hands-on event, you will learn how to work with Jupyter Notebooks - virtual notebooks that combine contextualization, code writing, and execution - using various data sets and digital collections from the Austrian National Library. 

**What can you expect?** 

The workshop offers a compact introduction to the basics of computer-assisted data analysis and shows how Jupyter Notebooks can be used to work with library data and metadata. In addition to basic explanations, the focus will be on practical exercises and the presentation of JNBs from the current project [“Data Analysis in the ONB Labs”](/projects/datenanalyse-oenb-labs/), which is funded by [CLARIAH-AT](https://clariah.at/en/). 

Using our Jupyter Notebooks, we will show you how 

➤ they are constructed generally, what they can be used for, and why they are so versatile; 

➤  to use them for research and data-based analysis, using the [ANNO](https://anno.onb.ac.at/) application programming interface (API) as an example, 

➤  to work with topographic data, taking the [“Austria in Aerial Views” data set](https://labs.onb.ac.at/en/datasets/austroflug/) as an example. In this context we will explain what geocoding is and how you can visualize geographic data, 

➤  search and evaluate the immense data collection from the [Austrian Web Archive](https://webarchiv.onb.ac.at/). 

The ONB Labs team will also assist you during the workshop in implementing your own ideas and exploring the further possibilities of the notebooks. 

**What are the requirements?** 

No programming skills or prior knowledge of the data used are required to participate. If you already have experience, that is of course an advantage, but the most important thing is your curiosity and desire to try new things and learn.
