### **General Information**

This CLARIN Café is co-organised by CLARIN-ERIC, and the [DH Course Registry Working Group](https://www.clarin.eu/content/digital-humanities-course-registry)as a follow-up to the [*DH Graduates: Bridging Gaps Between Industry & Education*](https://www.clarin.eu/blog/dh-graduates-bridging-gaps-between-industry-education) workshop, an initiative supported by CLARIN and the [DARIAH Funding Scheme for Working Group Activities 2023-2025](https://www.dariah.eu/2024/04/03/dariah-working-groups-funding-call-2023-meet-the-winning-projects/). The initiative examines how DH programs in Europe and the USA equip graduates for careers in academia, the public sector, and industry. It also investigates how research infrastructures, such as CLARIN and DARIAH, can assist universities in fostering their students' digital competencies through open access to language data repositories, language resources, services, tools, and learning materials.

The CLARIN hosts are **Vincent Vandeghinste** and **Iulianna van der Lek.**

*A full overview of planned Café sessions can be found on the [CLARIN Café page](https://www.clarin.eu/content/clarin-caf%C3%A9).*

### **About**

The topic of this café is **project management and team collaboration in Digital Humanities projects**. The guests from academia, industry and research infrastructures will discuss their experience and **approaches to project management** and how some of the principles and methods can be incorporated into DH research and teaching to improve the **collaboration** and **efficiency** of DH project teams. Depending on the size of a DH project, teams typically include researchers, students, faculty staff, technical experts, community partners, infrastructures, and/or representatives of the

or industry sectors. This topic also ties in with the previous [TwinTalks workshops](https://www.clarin.eu/event/2023/twintalks-workshop-dh2023), which investigated how researchers, teachers and professionals across disciplines and sectors can collaborate in a more creative and innovative way.

### **Target Audience** 

This café is designed for anyone looking to enhance their project management workflows and skills in the Digital Humanities field. It targets **research** **teams** managing Digital Humanities projects, **program coordinators, lecturers** who teach project management in academic programs, DH **graduates** working on projects in the creative and industry sectors, and professionals overseeing **DH infrastructure projects**. The café will also be of great interest to any **students** who, whether they know what career track they wish to embark upon or not, have a burning desire to get things done in their career: the natural builders and the natural creatives among the student body.
