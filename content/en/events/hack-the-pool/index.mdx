## **Event Details**

### **What is "Hack the Pool"?**

‘Hack the Pool’ is an inter-institutional cultural data hackathon organised by Kulturpool. The goal is to showcase the immense potential of cultural data by utilising Kulturpool's new APIs. Drawing inspiration from other cultural heritage data hackathons, such as the [Explore Salon](https://clariah.at/en/exploresalon2023) and the [Open Data Hackathon](https://www.data.gv.at/2025/03/19/open-data-hackathon-im-metalab-wien-datenschaetze-entdecken-und-nutzbar-machen/), we aim to foster a collaborative and inspiring environment where diverse skill sets can converge.

### **Who is the Hackathon intended for?**

‘Hack The Pool’ is aimed at anyone who is enthusiastic about cultural data and willing to use their skills to create something new:

**Developers** with programming skills
**Designers** with an eye for aesthetics and user experience\
**Artists** with creative visions and forms of expression \
**Data analysts** with a flair for patterns and correlations \
**Researchers** or **students** from the humanities or other disciplines \
Or **culture enthusiasts** with an idea who want to make a difference!

*We strongly encourage individuals and teams with different skills to apply. No prior knowledge of the Kulturpool APIs is required – we will provide a quick introduction and support.*

### **The Quests: Directions for your projects**

To give you some guidance and encourage the development of exciting projects, we have defined various ‘quests’ for your project. Be inspired and find your mission:

**Enrichment:** How can we enrich, supplement or link existing cultural data to make it even more valuable? Think about integrating geo-data, personal data or historical contexts.

**Data Exploration:** Develop innovative user interfaces or tools that enable a new, intuitive and playful exploration of cultural data. The aim is to promote serendipity and reveal hidden treasures.

**Connecting the dots:** Find unexpected connections and relationships between different data sets or cultural objects. Visualise these connections to generate new narrative storylines or research hypotheses.

**Visualisations:** Create engaging and informative visualisations that make complex cultural data accessible. From interactive maps to timelines to 3D models, let your creativity run wild to tell stories.

**3D:** Use 3D technologies to make cultural data spatially tangible. This could include the reconstruction of historical sites, the presentation of artworks in virtual environments, or the creation of immersive experiences.

**Computer Vision:** Apply computer vision techniques to recognise patterns in image and video data. This can include the automatic recognition of objects, people or styles in historical recordings, opening up new avenues for data analysis.

### **The Database: New Kulturpool APIs**

The basis for your projects is provided by the brand-new APIs of the Kulturpool, which give you access to a wealth of cultural data:

**Search-API:** Enables efficient searching and querying of cultural data from various institutions.

**OAI-PMH API:** Provides a standardised way to harvest and integrate metadata from cultural institutions.

**API for institutional data:** Provides information about the participating cultural institutions themselves.

**API for editorial content:** Enables access to curated articles, stories and background information about cultural heritage.

In addition, **tokens for external LLM models** are available via [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/?ref=info.kulturpool.at) to expand your projects with additional functions and possibilities.

## **Further Information**

**Slam / By volume:** At the end of the hackathon, the teams present their results in a relaxed ‘slam’ format, which focuses on the creativity and impact of the projects.

To give you an idea of what can be achieved at cultural data hackathons, we recommend taking a look at successful examples such as [Exploresalon 2023](https://clariah.at/en/exploresalon2023?ref=info.kulturpool.at) or [Coding Davinci](https://codingdavinci.de/?ref=info.kulturpool.at).
