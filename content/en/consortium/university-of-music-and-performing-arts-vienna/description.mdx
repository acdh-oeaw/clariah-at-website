The mdw - University of Music and Performing Arts Vienna is one of the world's largest universities for the performing arts of music, theater and film. The mdw educates around 3,000 students from 70 countries in these fields of study as well as a range of scientific subjects. At the scientific and artistic [departments](https://www.mdw.ac.at/59/), in a number of [research centers](https://www.mdw.ac.at/1560/) and within the framework of third-party funded [projects](https://www.mdw.ac.at/61/), the focus is on basic research in the humanities, social, cultural and natural sciences as well as artistic research.

In addition to the mdw [archive](https://www.mdw.ac.at/arc/), the [Historical Collection of the Institute for Musicology and Interpretation Research](https://www.mdw.ac.at/imi/archiv_und_phonothek/), the archive of the [Institute for Folk Music Research and Ethnomusicology](https://www.mdw.ac.at/ive/archiv-1/) and the [Exilarte Center](https://exilarte.org/en/nachlaesse) of the mdw are important foundations for research. Some of the holdings have been made accessible in online exhibitions such as [If these objects could speak](https://exilarte.org/en/nachlaesse) or [Ružake gila - Ruža's songs](https://www.musicandminorities.org/projects/ruzake-gila/) of the Music and Minorities Research Center.

The digitization of the [estates](https://www.bibliothek.mdw.ac.at/?PageId=2055) of important artists by the University Library, online databases, e.g. the Arnold Schönberg and the Vienna School Research Center, [The Correspondence between Arnold Schönberg and his Publishers Universal-Edition and Verlag Dreililien](https://www.mdw.ac.at/imi/correspondence-schoenberg-ue/), as well as research projects such as [ACONTRA](https://www.mdw.ac.at/imi/acontra/) play an important role in the further development of the field of Digital Humanities at the mdw.

The field of digital musicology is becoming increasingly important. The online tool [mei-friend](https://marketplace.sshopencloud.eu/tool-or-service/2BdfOq) is already available in the SSH Open Marketplace and is used, for example, in the [E-LAUTE](https://luteconv.mdw.ac.at/) project.

With its [Artistic Research Center](https://www.mdw.ac.at/ar_center/about-arc/), the mdw is an institutional member of the [Research Catalogue](https://www.researchcatalogue.net/) publication platform for artistic research operated by the Society for Artistic Research.
