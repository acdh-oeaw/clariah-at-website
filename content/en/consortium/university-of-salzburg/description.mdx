The *Paris Lodron University Salzburg PLUS* comprises six faculties with 34 departments and around 90 degree programmes in digital and analytical, natural and life sciences, social sciences, cultural studies, theology, law and economics. Almost 18,000 students complete bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral studies here.

Founded in 1622 by Prince Archbishop Paris Lodron and rebuilt in 1962, the PLUS is today the largest educational institution in Salzburg.

The particular strength of the *History Department at PLUS* is its wide range of content and methods: from the Middle Ages to the latest contemporary history, from regional to global history.\
The department promotes academic exchange through international cooperation and projects, and seeks contact with urban society and the historically interested public through regional cooperation (including with museums and archives).

At the *Department of German Studies* at the University of Salzburg everything revolves around German language, literature and culture from its beginnings in the early Middle Ages to the immediate present.\
Various degree programmes offer a broad education in literature and linguistics and allow individual specialisations.\
In addition to the Bachelor’s and Master’s degree programmes in German Studies and the teacher training programme for the teaching of German, students can choose the Master’s degree programme in Literature and Cultural Studies or Linguistics, which, in cooperation with other departments, allows for comparative specialisations.

The *Interdisciplinary Centre for the Middle Ages and Early Modern Period* (IZMF) sees itself as a centre for interdisciplinary research and teaching on the Middle Ages and Early Modern Period at the University of Salzburg. It is conceived as an interfaculty institution with the task of networking all activities related to the Middle Ages in research and teaching and thereby achieving the highest possible synergy and innovation effects. The core objective is to work on the Middle Ages as a complex research subject with all its historical and cultural-historical phenomena through the cooperation of various medievalist disciplines in research and teaching.

The *Middle High German Conceptual Database* (MHDBDB) provides access to the most important works of Middle High German poetry from a wide variety of perspectives via an extremely versatile search functionality.

The user can not only search for words, character strings and terms from various sources, but also evaluate just about any linguistic or semantic question to the text base.\
The two most important modules of the MHDBDB are the [word index with terms](http://mhdbdb.sbg.ac.at/help/dictionary.de.html) and the [text search for citations](http://mhdbdb.sbg.ac.at/help/search.de.html).

The *Institute for Medieval and Early Modern Material Culture* (IMAREAL) is a cultural studies research institute of the University of Salzburg located in Krems / Danube. The participating scholars focus their research on topics of material culture and take a historical perspective (12th-17th centuries) on the manifold interrelations between people and the material world.\
With this profile, IMAREAL has been the only academic institution of its kind since its foundation in 1969. Since 2012, the University of Salzburg has been the sponsor of the institute, which is additionally supported by basic funding from the province of Lower Austria and the city of Krems.
