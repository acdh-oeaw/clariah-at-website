The Central European University is an English-speaking, research-focused but student-centered private university with campuses in Vienna and in Budapest. CEU is accredited in Austria and in the United States and constitutes a part of the so-called [OSUN (Open Society University Network)](https://opensocietyuniversitynetwork.org/) together with Bard College in New York State. All the degree-granting programs are now taught in Vienna, whereas the majority of the well-known summer university programs, part of the library, several research centers, as well as the [Blinken OSA Archivum](https://archivum.org/) are housed in Budapest. CEU has a strong focus on the social sciences and the humanities and actively aims to become integrated into the Austrian and international digital humanities scene while also making its projects more visible in this community.

From the perspective of DH specifically, CEU is now on the map of DH in the [DH course registry](https://dhcr.clarin-dariah.eu/) and has launched an [Advanced Certificate in Digital Humanities](https://dhcr.clarin-dariah.eu/courses/view/846) in September 2024, which is coordinated by the Department of Historical Studies and the Department of Network and Data Science (but other departments such as Environmental Studies, etc. are also interested or involved in digitally-enhanced projects).

Multilingualism and multiculturalism constitute some of the most important assets of CEU. We aim to make use of this by offering a linguistically and thematically diverse and inclusive, interdisciplinary, and doable DH program with both theoretical and practical courses (currently for MA and PhD students). This is a solid basis which can hopefully help us establish ourselves as a central hub in multilingual DH with a focus on strengthening the representation of under-represented and under-resourced languages in digital humanities, particularly non-Latin scripts.

Besides research and teaching, CEU, and the [Blinken OSA Archivum](https://archivum.org/) in particular, have been extensively engaged in digitization and has made more than 144Â 000 digitized and openly accessible items available.

The CEU is also part of the [FWF Cluster of Excellence EurAsian Transformations](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/eurasian-transformations/home) and actively seeks to strengthen the collaboration between the Cluster (and its Digital Text Lab) and CLARIAH-AT.
