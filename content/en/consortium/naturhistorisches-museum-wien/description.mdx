The [Natural History Museum Vienna (NHMV)](https://nhm.at/en) is one of Austria's largest non-university research institutions dealing with biodiversity, geosciences and cultural heritage. 

With over 30 million objects, the NHMW has a unique collection and a [state-of-the-art infrastructure](https://www.nhm-wien.ac.at/en/research/research_infrastructure) that provide the basis for excellent disciplinary, interdisciplinary and participatory research.  

The NHM Vienna aims to significantly contribute to sustainable development in Austria, Europe and the world, for example through the [digital accessibility of its own collections and research results](https://www.nhm-wien.ac.at/research/digital_databases). The institution is committed to the principles of Open Science and ensures that research results are accessible, reusable and interoperable in compliance with FAIR standards. 

As part of [interdepartmental projects](https://www.nhm-wien.ac.at/en/research/interdepartmental_projects) and [networks](https://www.nhm-wien.ac.at/en/research/networks), the NHM Vienna strives for international networking and the cross-border visibility of its research.

The museum actively develops and distributes [open source tools](https://github.com/nhmvienna) to support the global research community.  In addition, the NHMW is dedicated to communicating knowledge to a wide audience, using interactive and participatory methods and immersive technologies. With initiatives such as [Deck50](https://www.nhm-wien.ac.at/en/deck50) and web portals such as [Kulturpool](https://kulturpool.at/en), [bITEM](https://bitem.at/) and [SALZZEIT,](https://salzzeit.at/) the museum reaches different target groups both online and offline, promoting access to educational and participatory offerings.
