The **University of Vienna** is the largest and one of the oldest universities of the German-speaking area. Its ca. 90.000 students and 10.000 employees work in 20 faculties/centres and several service and central support units, many of which deal with matters digital.

The University’s [Master’s program in Digital Humanities](https://datascience.univie.ac.at/masters/master-digital-humanities/) is organized together by the Faculties of [Historical and Cultural Studies](https://hist-kult.univie.ac.at/en/), and that of [Philological and Cultural Studies](https://phil-kult.univie.ac.at/en/) which both have dedicated personnel on all academic levels who represent a broad variety of different approaches to data and computer-based research. These two faculties collaborate closely with other relevant stakeholders inside the university, e.g. with the [University Library](http://bibliothek.univie.ac.at/english/), the [Computer Center](https://zid.univie.ac.at/en/) and the institutional repositories [PHAIDRA](https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/) and [AUSSDA](https://aussda.at/) as well as with the [Vice-Rectorate for Digitalisation and Knowledge Transfer](https://rektorat.univie.ac.at/en/rectorate/) and the [Research Network Data Science](https://datascience.univie.ac.at/). But also outside the University, DH-related collaboration is going on with other relevant institutions in the field, in Austria and beyond.
