Come to the ***ExploreSalon*** to unveil hidden stories from the past.

When people interact, they leave traces: uncountable letters, diaries, chronicles, plaques, and other written records have preserved memories about people – long before the rise of smartphones and social media.

For the duration of one week the ExploreSalon at the ACDH-CH in Vienna offers a space to explore those digitized memories, seek hidden stories, discuss and share ideas as well as findings.

![What we are doing](/assets/content/de/pages/exploresalon2023/what-we-are-doing-2.png)

From **May 22 – May 26** the ExploreSalon, a collaborative space in the heart of Vienna, opens its doors to dedicate time to explore innovative insights into storytelling with data:

You may choose between a number of curated biographic, spatial and temporal datasets with focus on Vienna 1900 to play with. Alternatively, you may suggest other datasets or bring your own.

While you engage in the creative process together with your team, the mentors offer on-site and online expert consultancy, providing the opportunity for peer feedback and sharing experiences. At the end of the week, you will have the chance to showcase your ideas and – if applicable – share any results with other participants.
