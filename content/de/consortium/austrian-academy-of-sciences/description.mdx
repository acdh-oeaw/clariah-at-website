The Austrian Academy of Sciences (OEAW) is Austria's largest non-university research facility with over 1300 employees looking back on a history of over 170 years.

In 2015, the Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities and Cultural Heritage (ACDH-CH), jointly founded by the Academy and the Ministry of Science, Research and Economy, was established with the declared intention of fostering the digital paradigm in the humanities. In their research, the centre works on text- and language-related questions focusing on non-standard and historical linguistic varieties as well as eLexicography and scholarly digital editions. In numerous projects across a wide range of digitally mediated humanities disciplines, the ACDH-CH works on digital language resources and related standards, semantic technologies, domain-specific virtual research environments and repositories for preservation of valuable digital research data.
