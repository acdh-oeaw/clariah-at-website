The Digital Humanities Research Centre (FZDH) at the University of Innsbruck supports the development and use of digital methods and tools in research in the cultural sciences and humanities. In addition to focal points in edition philology, corpus linguistics, network research and digital history, digital research infrastructures have also been established in recent years. One example is the Transkribus platform, which is one of the most widely used DH tools worldwide. The FZDH is also part of the research focus DiSC (Digital Science Centre) and the FSP Cultural Encounters â€“ Cultural Conflicts. More than 100 scientists are currently involved in the FZDH.
