Sean M. Winslow, PhD, is a medieval and Ethiopianist book historian and a digital humanist. A specialist in the craft practices of manuscript production, he works on the intersection of material culture and the written word, from papyrus to hypertext. In his time at the ZIM-ACDH, he has worked on the modelling of pre-modern charters in the TEI, the digital representation of Syriac manuscript treasures, and the digital cataloguing of Ethiopian binding decoration. As part of this work, he has developed an interest in the automatic detection of elements for cataloguing via computer vision and its inverse, text-to-image generation.
