Christoph KÃ¼hberger is a university professor for history and political didactics at the Department of History at Paris Lodron University Salzburg. His interest in teaching history and politics in the context of digital humanities concerns formal and informal learning, such as with [computer games or learning apps](http://www.museumsapp.at). Above all, he also tries to document the effect of digital interventions on historical and political thinking by means of empirical research.
