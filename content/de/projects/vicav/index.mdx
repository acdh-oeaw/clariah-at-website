The _Vienna Corpus of Arabic Varieties_ is a project and a varied collection of materials concerning a wide range of varieties of spoken Arabic. It provides language profiles (concise linguistic descriptions of particular varieties), dictionaries, corpora, bibliographies and more.

The _Vienna Corpus of Arabic Varieties_ has been conducted as a co-operation between the _Department of Oriental Studies_ of the _University of Vienna_ and the _Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities_ of the _Austrian Academy of Sciences_. It is also part of CLARIN-AT's project bundle aiming at more language resources for under-resourced linguistic varieties.

Apart from its linguistic goals, the project has been pursuing strong interests in various aspects of text technology. The output of the work of the contributors is published in form of different types of digital language resources. The ACDH's research interests in this project have been related to issues of digital lexicography, visualisation of digital language resources in a multilingual environment und the application of standards and de-facto standards such as TEI, LMF and/or MAF in the creation of digital language resources.

Several electronic dictionaries of arabic varieties are already available (Cairo, Damascus and Tunis). Visit the [website](https://vicav.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/).
