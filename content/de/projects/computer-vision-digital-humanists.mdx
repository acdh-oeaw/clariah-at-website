Computer Vision has become a very relevant skill for many Digital Humanists, but it is hard to distinguish how we can best budget our time and efforts to engage with this new technology. This workshop will provide a conceptual introduction to the processes involved, coupled with hands-on exercises that focus on the ways that we, as humanists, can curate content and manage metadata to make the best use of new tools available.
